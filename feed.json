Yesterday it suddenly stopped connecting to my MacBook Pro (M1). It was listed, but clicking on connect did nothing. I made macOS Ventura forget the device and tried to reconnect it, but to no avail. I shut down the keyboard and rebooted everything, still no luck. I held the power button on the keyboard (no cable to connect with) until it flashed, tried several new batteries, asked the internet and just could not find a solution. </p>\n<p>It turned out that I had to press and hold the power button on my keyboard until it went into pairing mode, and <strong>I had to hold it down throughout the entire setup process</strong>, even while entering the pairing code (it did not even show up with my other approaches, only spinning indicators resulting in dead ends). I am 100% certain that I have never performed such an acrobatic dance to connect a keyboard to a computer before. But maybe I'm going senile.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<h1>What I did in week six, 2023</h1>\n<p>In continuation to week <a href=\"http://week.esamecar.net/05\">five</a>, here are the things I was interested in week six, 2023:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>🐍 A <a href=\"http://week.esamecar.net/02\">few weeks ago</a>, I had the top case of my MacBook replaced because the battery was defective. I took the opportunity to completely reinstall the system. Most of it is now up and running, but <a href=\"https://www.python.org\">Python 3</a> was still missing. Python is a programming language that even I understand to some extent, but the installation is an absolute mess. This time I first installed <a href=\"https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv\">pyenv</a> via <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">Homebrew</a> and then Python. Maybe then the handling of the different versions won't slip through my fingers quite so quickly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python_environment.png\" alt=\"xkcd comic Python Environment\" title=\"xkcd comic Python Environment\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>✅ From time to time, I try to replace certain apps with Apple's own and see if they are now so good that I can do without third-party apps. A few weeks ago, I tried this with task management. I've been a <a href=\"https://culturedcode.com/things/\">Things</a> user since day one, managing both my work and personal tasks. Later, it became too confusing and I wanted to separate work and private tasks. I then used <a href=\"https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus\">OmniFocus</a> for work and Things for my private life. Unfortunately, the Siri integration via the Apple Watch didn't work well, especially because Siri doesn't understand English terms, like \"Things\" on German-language systems. Therefore, Siri never understood to which app I want to add a task to. That's why I gave up on Things a few years ago and used Apple's Reminders app for my private tasks. Thanks to smart lists, tags etc. I thought that I could possibly also manage my professional tasks with Reminders. But two weeks later I realised that this is not yet an option for me. The filter options for the smart lists are too limited, because you can't, for example, include one list and exclude another. Since I don't like the beta of OmniFocus 4 at all so far, I shifted my professional tasks to Things. I like the app a lot and I think I'm happy with the solution again for now.</li>\n<li>📺 Started watching <a href=\"https://trakt.tv/shows/star-wars-the-bad-batch/seasons/2\">Star Wars: The Bad Batch: Season 2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/95480\">Slow Horses (2022)</a>.</li>\n<li>📺 Continued watching <a href=\"https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/199318\">Bad Sisters (2022)</a> - ★★★★☆</li>\n<li>🍿 Watched <a href=\"https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/505642\">Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022)</a>.

In addition, I wanted to completely abstain from alcohol for a month. Both worked out well. I'm sticking to meatless dinners and I've also stopped drinking a delicious pale ale or something else during the week. I think that can't hurt in the end. Since this has worked so well, I have come up with two new things for February: no sweets, chocolate, cakes or similar foods with a lot of added sugar. And additionally, no coffee. I had real withdrawal symptoms for the first two or three days (headache, fatigue, slight aching limbs). It's so hard for me to do without a delicious coffee in the morning. But well, there are only a good two weeks left. I don't know yet what nonsense I'll come up with for next month.  🤦‍♂️</li>\n</ul>\n",

It was a rather intimate podcast. And both the developers of the <a href=\"https://darknoise.app\">Darknoise</a> app and <a href=\"https://sofahq.com\">Sofa</a> seem to be very nice people. After what they said about <strong>software subscriptions</strong>, I&rsquo;m afraid that sooner or later all apps will have to switch to the subscription model. I personally don&rsquo;t like that, but if there&rsquo;s no other way for indie developers, you probably have to think about what you&rsquo;re willing to spend per year and then keep an eye on your subscriptions, e.g. with <a href=\"https://bobbyapp.co\">Bobby</a>, and limit them accordingly.</li>\n<li>🛋️ Speaking of <a href=\"https://sofahq.com\">Sofa</a>. I really like the app, but I think I&rsquo;ll try to stay away from software and services where it&rsquo;s not possible to get your data out again with open standards, an API or at least an RSS feed.</li>\n<li>🫰 Speaking of subscriptions, after all this <a href=\"https://mas.to/@dcrainmaker/109761992004211636\">back and forth</a>, I <strong>cancelled my Strava subscription</strong>. I&rsquo;ll see if I can enjoy cycling without all their pro features.</li>\n<li>🚴‍♂️ Speaking of (I know, I know &hellip;) cycling, once again I have felt annoyed, no, <strong>threatened by SUV</strong> drivers. I really don&rsquo;t know where all this is going. Fittingly, the <a href=\"https://indieweb.social/@magalhini/109739198359436268\">post</a> about the size of cars.</li>\n<li>🐘 I had a look at <strong><a href=\"https://social.shadowfacts.net/objects/25db7fa3-31e5-46aa-a534-643de7617f8e\">Tusker</a></strong>, a new iOS Mastodon client. It&rsquo;s still fun to see all these many ideas for Mastodon clients. There hasn&rsquo;t been so much dynamism in the scene for a long time. Even though <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ice-cubes-for-mastodon/id6444915884\">IceCube</a> gets a lot of praise, I keep coming back to <a href=\"https://tapbots.com/ivory/\">Ivory</a>, which was finally released in the App Store this week. You can only have missed it, though, if you&rsquo;ve been living under a rock. Even though I find the development speed of IceCube absolutely remarkable and the app is certainly one of the most impressive in terms of features, I am still bothered by the many small bugs and especially the bad scrolling performance. (I think SwiftUI might be the one to blame here.) Ivory, on the other hand, is really fast and performant. The great thing is that you can change at any time.</li>\n<li>🕹️ I&rsquo;ve played the two new <strong>playdate games</strong> that were released for me this week: <a href=\"https://play.date/games/flipper-lifter/\">Flipper Lifter</a> and <a href=\"https://play.date/games/echoic-memory/\">Echoic Memory</a>. I am really bad at audio and don&rsquo;t know if I enjoy Echoic Memory and I haven&rsquo;t found any access to Flipper Lifter yet. In general, with some playdate games, I sometimes feel like I don&rsquo;t really understand the mechanics of the game, and just do anything that will somehow get me to the goal. I sometimes wish the games would introduce you a little more and not leave you completely out in the cold.</li>\n<li>🕹️ In the end, everything was overshadowed by the fact that my <strong>playdate</strong> probably <strong>has</strong> a <strong>faulty battery</strong>. I have, surprisingly unexpectedly, received an answer from <a href=\"https://social.panic.com/@cabel/109757052741921514\">Cabel</a>, but unfortunately not yet from support.

Unfortunately, I'm completely musically untalented, so I haven't looked at Boogie Loops yet, but I despair of Crankin's Time Travel Adventure.

Another game on the list of games I will never play through. <a href=\"https://rngpartygames.itch.io/bloom\">Bloom</a> meanders along. I find it a bit of a pity that in the dialogues there are really only the same statements available, each worded a little differently. I don't feel that you can really influence the story. I'm not 100% sure if I would buy the game again. I had a quick look at <a href=\"https://ronlent.itch.io/eyeland\">EYELAND</a>. However, it doesn't support savegames and so far I haven't felt like trying to tackle it in one go.</li>\n<li>🎧 Podcasts: Despite the ones I regularly listen to (<a href=\"https://atp.fm\">ATP</a>, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/\">The Talk Show</a>, <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/automators\">Automators</a>, <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/connected\">Connected</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ridehome.info/show/techmeme-ride-home/\">Techmeme Ride Home</a>) and due to <a href=\"https://esamecar.net\">my</a> recent interest in <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">micro.blog</a> and <a href=\"https://home.omg.lol\">omg.lol</a>, I stumbled upon <a href=\"https://hemisphericviews.com\">Hemispheric Views</a> by <a href=\"https://micro.blog/canion/\">Andrew Canion</a>, <a href=\"https://micro.blog/burk\">Jason Burk</a>, and <a href=\"https://micro.blog/martinfeld\">Martin Feld</a> as well as <a href=\"https://coreint.org\">Core Intuition</a> by <a href=\"https://micro.blog/manton\">Manton Reece</a> and <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@danielpunkass\">Daniel Jalkut</a>. </li>\n<li>📔 I've written a follow up post to my <a href=\"https://esamecar.net/2023/01/12/a-short-list.html\">short list of non-work related macOS apps I really like</a>: <a href=\"https://esamecar.net/2023/01/14/even-more-macos.html\">Even more macOS apps I enjoy using</a> 😎</li>\n<li>🍿 I've watched <a href=\"https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/76600-avatar-the-way-of-water\">Avatar: The Way of Water</a> in the cinema with my family. Bombastic, sure, but - as expected - completely irrelevant and above all predictable plot. Still, I didn't regret going to the cinema again.</li>\n<li>📺 Together with my wife I finished watching the third season of <a href=\"https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/87917-for-all-mankind/season/3\">For All Mankind</a>. I think I liked it better than the second and I'm looking forward to the fourth.</li>\n<li>🤓 Because of <a href=\"https://home.omg.lol\">omg.lol</a> , I tried to understand <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat\">IRC</a>. It's been a long time since I was on it. It felt like back in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga\">Amiga</a> days. I've installed <a href=\"https://irssi.org/\">irssi</a> via <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">Homebrew</a>, was able to connect, but failed with its operation. I'll have to look at it again some other time. Even though I am not a fan of, I understand very well why <a href=\"https://discord.com\">Discord</a> etc. have become famous 🤦‍♂️</li>\n<li>🍩 I've 3Dprinted some small things, primarily for household or work purposes, such as an <a href=\"https://www.printables.com/de/model/96617-ipad-stand\">iPad Stand</a>, to use it as a second monitor at work and a <a href=\"https://www.printables.com/de/model/295408-tea-bag-drainer-v2/files\">tea bag drainer</a>. And of course things for my AnkerMake M5 itself, like <a href=\"https://www.printables.com/de/model/304873-ankermake-m5-spare-parts-box/files\">Spare Parts Box</a> and <a href=\"https://www.printables.com/model/345230-accessory-bins-for-ankermake-m5\">Accessory Bins</a>. (I was already afraid that this is another hobby that is only concerned with itself. In other words, you do things with it that you only do because you now have this thing that does things ... You understand me.)</li>\n<li>🤯 For me, I still haven't been able to conclusively determine on which platform I want to follow whom and where I want to post something and how. The interoperability of the fedivers (micro.blog &lt;-&gt; mastodon together with RSS etc.) is ingenious, but it also leads to a lot of friction and redundancy at least for me. I definitely need to get better at this. In all the experimenting I've been doing over the last few days, I've often had the problem of finding the exact URL of an RSS feed. To achive this via Reeder or similar was too cumbersome  for me and the times when the browser I use simply displayed the feeds prominently are also long gone. I have therefore created an iOS/macOS <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/fcaa7a4964ff4c078a6a13047a59fdfe\">shortcuts</a>. I'm not good at it, but it does the job I hope.</li>\n<li>👨‍💻 Oh, I almost forgot. The battery on my private Intel MacBook Pro was dead. I had it replaced. It cost me € 229 - not exactly cheap. But the whole thing, including sending it in (to the Czech Republic, repair and return) took less than three days 👏. However, I got a new top case with a new keyboard etc., which probably wasn't a bad idea for that model. Since it had already been in use for several years, I decided to completely rebuild it. I would have preferred to save myself the experience. So many little macOS (iCloud) bugs in the process really annoyed me and the new system settings are hell.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>🙋‍♂️</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Here is a short list of apps I use a lot under macOS privately (so not only work related) or I have recently discovered and think I&rsquo;ll stick with them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://bunchapp.co/docs/\">Bunch</a>: Bunch describes itself as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;a macOS utility that uses plain text scripts called “Bunches” to automate context switching. It sits in your menu [&hellip;]. Bunches can open apps, specific files, web pages, and more. For the Power Users, It also allows advanced scripting, system commands, and integration via a URL handler&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s free to download, developed by <a href=\"https://nojack.easydns.ca/@ttscoff\">Brett Terpstra</a>. I switched from <a href=\"https://www.apptorium.com/workspaces\">Workspaces</a> by <a href=\"https://www.apptorium.com\">Apptorium</a>, which has a much more sophisticated visual concept. I also like the app very much and is also available via <a href=\"https://setapp.com/\">Setapp</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Typinator<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Enter words, sentences, or even entire paragraphs by typing just a few characters. Save time for the really important things in life.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> If I use a Mac without Typinator installed, I can hardly operate it. Therefore, it is one of the first programmes I add. (The second one is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1Password<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but if I would start from scratch I would try to use the new build in password manager of macOS / iOS.) Many use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Textexpander<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but I feel more comfortable without a subscription model.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.raycast.com\">Raycast</a>: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Raycast is a blazingly fast, totally extendable launcher. It lets you complete tasks, calculate, share common links, and much more.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Before I discovered Raycast, I&rsquo;ve used Launchbar for over 15 years. It was one of these apps I would have taken with me to an lonely island. Other apps like <a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com\">Alfred</a> did not stick with me. I still like <a href=\"https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html\">Launchbar</a> a lot but enjoy the I am currently enjoying the immense expandability and dynamic development of Raycast. Right now Raycast made even my beloved window manager <a href=\"https://manytricks.com/moom/\">Moom</a> obsolete.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.craft.do\">Craft</a>: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Create documents, make impact.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I really enjoyed using Craft for some time. But actually I think, I should not use another note silo and try to achieve what I want with Apple Notes. Nevertheless, the app is very comprehensive, cross platform and easy to begin with.

				"content_text": "Here is a short list of apps I use a lot under macOS privately (so not only work related) or I have recently discovered and think I'll stick with them.\n\n- [Bunch](https://bunchapp.co/docs/): Bunch describes itself as <em>\"a macOS utility that uses plain text scripts called “Bunches” to automate context switching. It sits in your menu [...]. Bunches can open apps, specific files, web pages, and more. For the Power Users, It also allows advanced scripting, system commands, and integration via a URL handler\"</em>. It's free to download, developed by [Brett Terpstra](https://nojack.easydns.ca/@ttscoff). I switched from [Workspaces](https://www.apptorium.com/workspaces) by [Apptorium](https://www.apptorium.com), which has a much more sophisticated visual concept. I also like the app very much and is also available via [Setapp](https://setapp.com/).\n\n- <a href=\"https://ergonis.com/typinator\">Typinator</a>: <em>\"Enter words, sentences, or even entire paragraphs by typing just a few characters. Save time for the really important things in life.\"</em> If I use a Mac without Typinator installed, I can hardly operate it. Therefore, it is one of the first programmes I add. (The second one is <a href=\"https://1password.com/\">1Password</a>, but if I would start from scratch I would try to use the new build in password manager of macOS / iOS.) Many use <a href=\"https://textexpander.com/\">Textexpander</a>, but I feel more comfortable without a subscription model.\n\n- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com): <em>\"Raycast is a blazingly fast, totally extendable launcher. It lets you complete tasks, calculate, share common links, and much more.\"</em> Before I discovered Raycast, I've used Launchbar for over 15 years. It was one of these apps I would have taken with me to an lonely island. Other apps like [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) did not stick with me. I still like [Launchbar](https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html) a lot but enjoy the I am currently enjoying the immense expandability and dynamic development of Raycast. Right now Raycast made even my beloved window manager [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/) obsolete.  \n\n- [Craft](https://www.craft.do): <em>\"Create documents, make impact.\"</em> I really enjoyed using Craft for some time. But actually I think, I should not use another note silo and try to achieve what I want with Apple Notes. Nevertheless, the app is very comprehensive, cross platform and easy to begin with. If you have a [Setapp](https://setapp.com/de/apps/craft) subscription, you should definitely check it out. (At this point, of course, <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a> and <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/\">Notion</a> must also be mentioned, but neither of which I use in a private context so far.)\n\n- [Anybox](https://anybox.app): <em>\"Manage bookmarks like a pro. A perfect replacement for your browser’s bookmark manager.\"</em> I have never been able to make friends with Safari's bookmark management and used to use various services, including [del.icio.us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)). Then I migrated to [pinboard.in](), and in the meantime I only used it sporadically. [Pins](https://get-pins.app), a very good iOS / macOS pinboard client by [Anh Do](https://mastodon.social/@anhdo), motivated me again to use pinboard more extensively. But recently my use declined rapidly again - I don't know exactly why. I didn't like well-known alternatives like [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) and then Anybox came along.

				"content_html": "<p>I was motivated by <a href=\"https://micro.blog/muhh\">muhh</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.byzero.de/2023/01/08/week-its-a.html\">blog entry</a> to write down what was on my mind in the first week of January. I&rsquo;m not sure yet if this will become something more regular, but I wanted to start putting something online more often anyway - more on that below.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve had the last two weeks off. The weather was bad, I had a cold 🤧 and therefore a lot of cycling wasn&rsquo;t an option either (at least that&rsquo;s what I told myself). So, I used the time to hang out at the computer a little more than usally. There was a lot of exciting things to discover there.\nSomehow Elon started this with the downfall of twitter, which he initiated. I had only been there reading for years anyway, and then after the takeover I decided to download my data, delete the clients on my end devices and no longer use the account.</p>\n<p>As an alternative, I was of course interested in Mastodon and clicked an account on the standard instance <a href=\"https://mastodon.social\">mastodon.social</a>. Thanks to tools like <a href=\"https://www.movetodon.org\">movetodon</a> and <a href=\"https://glitch.com/~fedifinder\">fedifinder</a> my timeline has also filled up pretty quickly, and I actually &ldquo;met&rdquo; pretty quickly some real people with whom you could exchange ideas in a friendly manner. All in all a very positive experience.</p>\n<p>One great thing about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse\">fediverse </a> is the extreme dynamics of the tools and clients that are currently being built around it. It feels like back in the early days of Twitter where, for example, a single programmer, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loren_Brichter\">Loren Brichter</a>, with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweetie\">Tweetie</a> could turn the whole twitter landscape upside down. (BTW he only has an <a href=\"https://mastodon.cloud/@loren\">inactive account</a> on Mastodon 😢)</p>\n<p>I tried countless clients over a few days. Among others (unsorted)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ice Cubes for Mastodon (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->beta<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) by <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@dimillian\">@dimillian</a> (<a href=\"@icecubesapp@mastodon.cloud\">@icecubesapp</a>),</li>\n<li>Mammoth: for Mastodon (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->beta<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) by <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@JPEGuin\">@JPEGuin@mastodon.social</a>,</li>\n<li>Wolly for Mastodon (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->beta<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Matteo<!-- raw HTML omitted -->,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mastoot/id1501485410\">Mastoot</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mastodon/id1571998974\">Mastodon</a> (official app),</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/toot/id1229021451\">Toot!</a> (on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mastodon<!-- raw HTML omitted -->),</li>\n<li>Komondor (beta) by <a href=\"https://chaos.social/@343max\">@343max@chaos.social</a> <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>, and</li>\n<li>Ivory (beta; officially alpha ;-)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The official app is okay, but IMHO not great; toot! I liked the range of functions very much, but you also have to cope with the strange design somehow. Because I follow some accounts that post a lot, and since the timeline on Mastodon is not orchestrated by any algorithms, posts from other people are in danger of being lost. Thats why a good list function is very important to me personally. There, Mammoth also makes a very good impression, but in the end I was lucky and was able to test <a href=\"https://tapbots.social/@ivory\">Ivory</a> via Testflight. The app by <a href=\"https://tapbots.social/@paul\">Paul Haddad</a> and <a href=\"https://tapbots.social/@mark\">Mark Jardine</a> has an button design that is a bit too playful for my taste, but otherwise it is extremely stable and really great at everything it does. The recently added <a href=\"https://social.lol/@esamecar/109653526172609597\">list features</a> are awesome, as they allow certain accounts to be hidden from the home view.

I'm not sure yet if this will become something more regular, but I wanted to start putting something online more often anyway - more on that below.\n\nI've had the last two weeks off. The weather was bad, I had a cold 🤧 and therefore a lot of cycling wasn't an option either (at least that's what I told myself). So, I used the time to hang out at the computer a little more than usally. There was a lot of exciting things to discover there. \nSomehow Elon started this with the downfall of twitter, which he initiated. I had only been there reading for years anyway, and then after the takeover I decided to download my data, delete the clients on my end devices and no longer use the account.\n\nAs an alternative, I was of course interested in Mastodon and clicked an account on the standard instance [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social). Thanks to tools like [movetodon](https://www.movetodon.org) and [fedifinder](https://glitch.com/~fedifinder) my timeline has also filled up pretty quickly, and I actually \"met\" pretty quickly some real people with whom you could exchange ideas in a friendly manner. All in all a very positive experience.\n\nOne great thing about the [fediverse ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) is the extreme dynamics of the tools and clients that are currently being built around it. It feels like back in the early days of Twitter where, for example, a single programmer, [Loren Brichter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loren_Brichter), with [Tweetie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweetie) could turn the whole twitter landscape upside down. (BTW he only has an [inactive account](https://mastodon.cloud/@loren) on Mastodon 😢) \n\nI tried countless clients over a few days. Among others (unsorted)\n- Ice Cubes for Mastodon (<a href=\"https://testflight.apple.com/join/tqI3dK1u\">beta</a>) by [@dimillian](https://mastodon.social/@dimillian) ([@icecubesapp](@icecubesapp@mastodon.cloud)),\n- Mammoth: for Mastodon (<a href=\"https://testflight.apple.com/join/HyL7boSn\">beta</a>) by [@JPEGuin@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@JPEGuin),\n- Wolly for Mastodon (<a href=\"https://testflight.apple.com/join/2LVAJQTP\">beta</a>) by <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@mttvll\">Matteo</a>,\n- [Mastoot](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mastoot/id1501485410),\n- [Mastodon](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mastodon/id1571998974) (official app),\n- [Toot!](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/toot/id1229021451) (on <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@tootapp\">Mastodon</a>),\n- Komondor (beta) by [@343max@chaos.social](https://chaos.social/@343max) [^1], and\n- Ivory (beta; officially alpha ;-)\n\nThe official app is okay, but IMHO not great; toot!

The app by [Paul Haddad](https://tapbots.social/@paul) and [Mark Jardine](https://tapbots.social/@mark) has an button design that is a bit too playful for my taste, but otherwise it is extremely stable and really great at everything it does. The recently added [list features](https://social.lol/@esamecar/109653526172609597) are awesome, as they allow certain accounts to be hidden from the home view.

I ordered it in July 2021 and finally received it a mere 1.5 years later. Since then I’ve really enjoyed the console. Every animation, every sound somehow expresses the joy and dedication that Cable Sasser and his team at <a href=\"https://panic.com/\">Panic</a> evidently put into the development of this – while <a href=\"https://shop.play.date/\">rather expensive</a> piece of hardware.</p>\n<p>I really like the first two games of <a href=\"https://play.date/games/\">Series 1</a> so far and they couldn’t be more different. <a href=\"https://play.date/games/whitewater-wipeout/\">Whitewater Wipeout</a> is quite a challenging game of skill in the spirit of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/o_2S5CSc97M \">California Games</a>, which I played with friends for hours on the C64 and immediately brought back fond memories. The game makes very good use of the crank. At first I was happy about 200 points, meanwhile it’s a few thousand and my sons, who grew up with graphically bombastic touchscreen games on iPad and Co. or complex titles on the PS4, also liked it straight away and now fill the high score. However, how you can achieve several million points in this game will probably always remain a mystery to me.</p>\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.racemat.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/CleanShot-2023-01-07-at-12.14.32.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Whitewater Wipeout Highscore on playdate\" border= \"0\" width=\"200\" />\n<p><a href=\"https://play.date/games/casual-birder/\">Casual Birder</a> is „a snap-‚em-all adventure set in beautiful seaside Bird Town“ and also entertaining. However, I haven’t really progressed very far here.</p>\n<p>I’m definitely looking forward to the next 20 games that are included in the purchase price, which also puts it into perspective, and I’m excited for the upcoming <a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch/TW2SHhYw0Vo?t=536\" >store</a> (aka <a href=\"https://playdate-wiki.com/wiki/Catalog\">catalog</a>).</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, you can load your own games and applications onto the device via USB or a website (called <a href=\"https://play.date/account/sideload/\">sideload</a>). A probably almost complete overview of all projects can be found on the <a href=\"https://playdate-wiki.com/wiki/Main_Page\">playdate community wiki</a>. The games are often offered on <a href=\"https://itch.io/games/tag-playdate\">itch.io</a> and usually cost somewhere between $1 and $10.</p>\n<p>So far I’ve been into <a href=\"https://rngpartygames.itch.io/bloom\">Bloom</a>, „a real-time narrative-driven social sim about starting up a flower shop“ and <a href =\"https://possiblyaxolotl.itch.io/rocketbytes\">Rocket Bytes</a>, „a 1-bit precision rocket flying reverse platformer“. The former is just plain nice, the latter hard as hell. Other games I would like to check out are <a href=\"https://ronlent.itch.io/eyeland\">EYELAND</a>, <a href=\"https://gingerbeardman.itch.io /daily-driver\">Daily Driver (Tech Demo)</a> and <a href=\"https://frankbsadgames.itch.io/a-balanced-brew\">A Balanced Brew</a>. And if you have a dollar left over, you can also buy <a href=\"https://kamibox.itch.io/a-joke-thats-worth-099\">A Joke Thats Worth $0.99</a> for a smile.</p>\n<p>As if that weren’t enough, Panic has an app called <a href=\"https://play.date/mirror/\">Mirror</a> that allows games to be streamed and recorded directly to a monitor. <a href=\"https://help.play.date/games/mirror/#key-uses\">Accessibility</a> has also been considered. And then of course there’s the <a href=\"https://play.date/dev/\">development environment</a>, once in professional and as if that wasn’t enough, also a comprehensive <a href=\"https ://play.date/pulp/\">web editor</a>, with which you can develop really professional games in the browser.</p>\n<p>It was also a good thing that I have been the happy owner of an <a href=\"https://www.ankermake.com/eu-en\">AnkerMake M5</a> since December 2022, so I was able to get a suitable <a href=\"https://www.printables.com/de/model/226801-magnetic-cover-for-playdate/files\">Magnetic Cover</a>, because unfortunately I didn’t have the official <a href=\" https://shop.play.date\">ordered</a> and now the shipping would be more expensive than the case itself ;-(</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://www.racemat.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8156-1.jpeg\" alt=\"3d printed magnetic cover for playdate\" title=\"IMG_8156.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"150\" /></p>\n<p>I’m excited to see how the little yellow part will continue, I’m looking forward to regular game updates for the next eleven weeks and at the same time I’ll be listening to the official <a href=\"https://podcast.play.date/\">podcast</a>. Long story short: for me personally a really compelling overall package.</p>\n",
