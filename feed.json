So, here comes week 47.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>🎮 I finished playing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_Forbidden_West\">Horizon Forbidden West</a>. It was my first computer game in years, and probably the first AAA title in decades that I actually watched the end credits for. Usually, I start playing and then eventually stop. (Why should it be any different with video games than with other areas of my life?) I invested over 100 hours into Forbidden West, and whether or not that was a waste of time is for each person to decide, but I had a lot of fun. Over the past two weeks, I used the <a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/playstation-portal-remote-player/\">Playstation Portal</a>. This accessory for the PS5 is essentially just a (pretty good, but unfortunately not OLED) screen with a built-in, very good controller - nothing more and nothing less. It allows me to play on the couch in the living room while my wife watches one of her shows. (My wife doesn&rsquo;t like me playing games on the TV in the living room when she&rsquo;s present.) <a href=\"https://birchtree.me/blog/playstation-portal-early-review/\">The Portal suffers</a> from the same weaknesses as Playstation&rsquo;s Remote Play itself: even with very good Wi-Fi coverage and the PS5 connected to the router with a cable (and <a href=\"https://heydingus.net/blog/2023/11/playstation-ethernet-connection\">properly configured</a>), there are regular artifacts, slow downs, and sometimes even stuttering. I really hope that Sony gives its Remote Play implementation a little bit more attention and love now that they sell a dedicated device for this feature. But ultimately, I&rsquo;m quite satisfied, and the hardware is really well-made. (The lack of Bluetooth support doesn&rsquo;t bother me at all; I wouldn&rsquo;t want to constantly pair BT headphones anyway, and I actually have some very good headphones with a headphone jack that are happy to have found a new use.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>👾 Recently, my <a href=\"https://powkiddy.com/products/pre-sale-powkiddy-rgb30-rk3566-handheld-game-console-built-in-wifi\">Powkiddy RGB30</a> also arrived. The handheld device was highly praised by a bunch of youtubers  and the 1:1 screen is really great for GB, GBA, and GBC games. I also really like <a href=\"https://github.com/JustEnoughLinuxOS/distribution/releases\">JELOS</a>. HOWEVER, the hardware quality and customer service of this device and this company are extremely poor. The device arrived defective, with a stuck shoulder button. I had to contact Powkiddy multiple times to get a response. They casually suggested that I could try opening it up. Opening up a device that is only a few days old, still under warranty, with a spatula and screwdriver is not exactly what I had in mind. I actually managed to open the case and free the button without causing major damage to the device. Shortly after, another shoulder button got stuck, and then the first one again. And if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, the card slot eject mechanism also broke. All within one week. I really don&rsquo;t feel like having to dismantle the device every two days just to play a game for a few minutes. Powkiddy mentioned that I could send the device back to China at my own expense and then get a refund - yeah, right. Never ever again! 😡</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>👾 Speaking of retro gaming, while setting up the RGB30, I stumbled upon the <a href=\"https://lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php\">pico-8</a> Fantasy Console and was immediately impressed. I wasn&rsquo;t aware of the extent of this community. There are so many nice games, and almost all of them are free. You can play them on macOS, a variety of other operating systems, and even on retro handhelds. And as if that weren&rsquo;t enough, there&rsquo;s also the <a href=\"https://tic80.com\">TIC-80</a>.

Yesterday it suddenly stopped connecting to my MacBook Pro (M1). It was listed, but clicking on connect did nothing. I made macOS Ventura forget the device and tried to reconnect it, but to no avail. I shut down the keyboard and rebooted everything, still no luck. I held the power button on the keyboard (no cable to connect with) until it flashed, tried several new batteries, asked the internet and just could not find a solution. </p>\n<p>It turned out that I had to press and hold the power button on my keyboard until it went into pairing mode, and <strong>I had to hold it down throughout the entire setup process</strong>, even while entering the pairing code (it did not even show up with my other approaches, only spinning indicators resulting in dead ends). I am 100% certain that I have never performed such an acrobatic dance to connect a keyboard to a computer before. But maybe I'm going senile.</p>\n",

I took the opportunity to completely reinstall the system. Most of it is now up and running, but <a href=\"https://www.python.org\">Python 3</a> was still missing. Python is a programming language that even I understand to some extent, but the installation is an absolute mess. This time I first installed <a href=\"https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv\">pyenv</a> via <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">Homebrew</a> and then Python. Maybe then the handling of the different versions won't slip through my fingers quite so quickly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python_environment.png\" alt=\"xkcd comic Python Environment\" title=\"xkcd comic Python Environment\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>✅ From time to time, I try to replace certain apps with Apple's own and see if they are now so good that I can do without third-party apps. A few weeks ago, I tried this with task management. I've been a <a href=\"https://culturedcode.com/things/\">Things</a> user since day one, managing both my work and personal tasks. Later, it became too confusing and I wanted to separate work and private tasks. I then used <a href=\"https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus\">OmniFocus</a> for work and Things for my private life. Unfortunately, the Siri integration via the Apple Watch didn't work well, especially because Siri doesn't understand English terms, like \"Things\" on German-language systems. Therefore, Siri never understood to which app I want to add a task to. That's why I gave up on Things a few years ago and used Apple's Reminders app for my private tasks. Thanks to smart lists, tags etc. I thought that I could possibly also manage my professional tasks with Reminders. But two weeks later I realised that this is not yet an option for me. The filter options for the smart lists are too limited, because you can't, for example, include one list and exclude another.

In addition, I wanted to completely abstain from alcohol for a month. Both worked out well. I'm sticking to meatless dinners and I've also stopped drinking a delicious pale ale or something else during the week. I think that can't hurt in the end. Since this has worked so well, I have come up with two new things for February: no sweets, chocolate, cakes or similar foods with a lot of added sugar. And additionally, no coffee. I had real withdrawal symptoms for the first two or three days (headache, fatigue, slight aching limbs). It's so hard for me to do without a delicious coffee in the morning. But well, there are only a good two weeks left. I don't know yet what nonsense I'll come up with for next month.  🤦‍♂️</li>\n</ul>\n",

It was a rather intimate podcast. And both the developers of the <a href=\"https://darknoise.app\">Darknoise</a> app and <a href=\"https://sofahq.com\">Sofa</a> seem to be very nice people. After what they said about <strong>software subscriptions</strong>, I&rsquo;m afraid that sooner or later all apps will have to switch to the subscription model. I personally don&rsquo;t like that, but if there&rsquo;s no other way for indie developers, you probably have to think about what you&rsquo;re willing to spend per year and then keep an eye on your subscriptions, e.g. with <a href=\"https://bobbyapp.co\">Bobby</a>, and limit them accordingly.</li>\n<li>🛋️ Speaking of <a href=\"https://sofahq.com\">Sofa</a>. I really like the app, but I think I&rsquo;ll try to stay away from software and services where it&rsquo;s not possible to get your data out again with open standards, an API or at least an RSS feed.</li>\n<li>🫰 Speaking of subscriptions, after all this <a href=\"https://mas.to/@dcrainmaker/109761992004211636\">back and forth</a>, I <strong>cancelled my Strava subscription</strong>. I&rsquo;ll see if I can enjoy cycling without all their pro features.</li>\n<li>🚴‍♂️ Speaking of (I know, I know &hellip;) cycling, once again I have felt annoyed, no, <strong>threatened by SUV</strong> drivers. I really don&rsquo;t know where all this is going. Fittingly, the <a href=\"https://indieweb.social/@magalhini/109739198359436268\">post</a> about the size of cars.</li>\n<li>🐘 I had a look at <strong><a href=\"https://social.shadowfacts.net/objects/25db7fa3-31e5-46aa-a534-643de7617f8e\">Tusker</a></strong>, a new iOS Mastodon client. It&rsquo;s still fun to see all these many ideas for Mastodon clients. There hasn&rsquo;t been so much dynamism in the scene for a long time. Even though <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ice-cubes-for-mastodon/id6444915884\">IceCube</a> gets a lot of praise, I keep coming back to <a href=\"https://tapbots.com/ivory/\">Ivory</a>, which was finally released in the App Store this week. You can only have missed it, though, if you&rsquo;ve been living under a rock. Even though I find the development speed of IceCube absolutely remarkable and the app is certainly one of the most impressive in terms of features, I am still bothered by the many small bugs and especially the bad scrolling performance. (I think SwiftUI might be the one to blame here.) Ivory, on the other hand, is really fast and performant. The great thing is that you can change at any time.</li>\n<li>🕹️ I&rsquo;ve played the two new <strong>playdate games</strong> that were released for me this week: <a href=\"https://play.date/games/flipper-lifter/\">Flipper Lifter</a> and <a href=\"https://play.date/games/echoic-memory/\">Echoic Memory</a>. I am really bad at audio and don&rsquo;t know if I enjoy Echoic Memory and I haven&rsquo;t found any access to Flipper Lifter yet. In general, with some playdate games, I sometimes feel like I don&rsquo;t really understand the mechanics of the game, and just do anything that will somehow get me to the goal. I sometimes wish the games would introduce you a little more and not leave you completely out in the cold.</li>\n<li>🕹️ In the end, everything was overshadowed by the fact that my <strong>playdate</strong> probably <strong>has</strong> a <strong>faulty battery</strong>. I have, surprisingly unexpectedly, received an answer from <a href=\"https://social.panic.com/@cabel/109757052741921514\">Cabel</a>, but unfortunately not yet from support. They seem to be quite overwhelmed by support requests right now.</li>\n<li>📱 On <strong>iOS</strong>, I looked at <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1489443070\">Countdown to Anything!</a> but I think I&rsquo;ll stick with <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/countdowns-termine-verfolgen/id917514700\">Countdowns</a>.</li>\n<li>📱 This <a href=\"https://social.lol/@inkeduprunner/109744118273037005\">screenshot</a> of Jason&rsquo;s homescreen inspired me to tinker a little bit with <a href=\"https://social.lol/@inkeduprunner/109744118273037005\">Widgy</a>. I also bought <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/opener-open-links-in-apps/id989565871\">Opener</a>, don&rsquo;t know why 😇</li>\n<li>💻 On the <strong>Mac</strong>, I&rsquo;ve been looking at the new <a href=\"https://thebrowser.company\">Arc</a> browser, which is kind of hyped right now. I really don&rsquo;t know why though. I have a bit of a suspicion that it might just be the invite system. To me, the browser seems extremely sluggish. My password management and Apple Pay don&rsquo;t work, which is probably not the browser&rsquo;s fault. It&rsquo;s too early to judge, but so far I always go back to Safari after a short time.</li>\n<li>💻 It came to my mind, that you can use Markdown links of <a href=\"https://mastodon.cloud/@cogsciapps/109758770719895321\">hooked</a> items together with <a href=\"https://sindresorhus.com/one-thing\">One Thing</a>, an App that I really enjoy. It gives you one click menu bar item to the one file you are just working on.</li>\n<li>💻 I had a look at <a href=\"https://hidock.app/\">HiDock, for Mac</a> and <a href=\"https://thelasso.app/\">Lasso - Window Manager for macOS</a>.</li>\n<li>💻 Thanks to <a href=\"https://social.lol/@mken/109750124058233654\">Matthew</a> I became aware of <a href=\"https://menubarx.app\">Menubar X</a> (<a href=\"https://setapp.com/de/apps/menubarx\">Setapp</a>).

The only thing I miss so far is the ability to filter by focus modes, like it is possible with Calendars, etc. Only Apple knows why this is not possible yet, I guess.</li>\n<li>❤️ Thanks to <a href=\"https://social.lol/@faisal/109750741237166481\">Faisal Misle</a>, I now also know that you can publish to the omg.lol weblog via <a href=\"https://github.com/neatnik/weblog.lol\">github</a>. I have no idea about all these things, but thanks to the many great tutorials, even I managed to do it.

Hope that I get the curve then next week.\n\n- 🍿 Watched [Raymond & Ray (2022)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/869025) - ★★★★☆ and enjoyed it.\n- 🎙️ Listend to a bunch of different **Podcasts**: \n    - [Accidental Tech Podcast: 518: Deconstructed iMac](https://overcast.fm/+R7DVtneAw), \n    - [Core Intuition: Episode 545: Lawful Evil](https://overcast.fm/+Kuq_jKm0Y), \n    - [MeTacheles Tonspur: Return of the Mac - Ode an den Apple Macintosh](https://overcast.fm/+4TI7Zrdgw), \n    - [Playdate Podcast: Flipper Lifter](https://overcast.fm/+5DdoG0klE), \n    - [Playdate Podcast: Echoic Memory](https://overcast.fm/+5DdoqkQbQ), \n    - [Techmeme Ride Home: Tue 01/24 – ALL The Details On Apple’s Headset](https://overcast.fm/+TRbU9iufs), \n    - [AppStories: Imagining Apps for an Apple VR Headset](https://overcast.fm/+I5Cmvd2J8), \n    - [Launched: 54: Sofa - Shawn Hickman](https://overcast.fm/+WB397kIrk), \n    - [Upgrade: 443: Core Variations](https://overcast.fm/+Fcm-k7iqs), and \n    - [Hemispheric Views: 076: Find Jason a House!](https://overcast.fm/+hdKNj8kKg). \n - 🎙️ This was my **first episode of [Launched](https://mastodon.social/@Launched/109744688589490094)**. It was a rather intimate podcast. And both the developers of the [Darknoise](https://darknoise.app) app and [Sofa](https://sofahq.com) seem to be very nice people. After what they said about **software subscriptions**, I'm afraid that sooner or later all apps will have to switch to the subscription model. I personally don't like that, but if there's no other way for indie developers, you probably have to think about what you're willing to spend per year and then keep an eye on your subscriptions, e.g. with [Bobby](https://bobbyapp.co), and limit them accordingly.\n- 🛋️ Speaking of [Sofa](https://sofahq.com). I really like the app, but I think I'll try to stay away from software and services where it's not possible to get your data out again with open standards, an API or at least an RSS feed.\n- 🫰 Speaking of subscriptions, after all this [back and forth](https://mas.to/@dcrainmaker/109761992004211636), I **cancelled my Strava subscription**. I'll see if I can enjoy cycling without all their pro features.\n- 🚴‍♂️ Speaking of (I know, I know ...) cycling, once again I have felt annoyed, no, **threatened by SUV** drivers. I really don't know where all this is going. Fittingly, the [post](https://indieweb.social/@magalhini/109739198359436268) about the size of cars.\n- 🐘 I had a look at **[Tusker](https://social.shadowfacts.net/objects/25db7fa3-31e5-46aa-a534-643de7617f8e)**, a new iOS Mastodon client. It's still fun to see all these many ideas for Mastodon clients. There hasn't been so much dynamism in the scene for a long time. Even though [IceCube](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ice-cubes-for-mastodon/id6444915884) gets a lot of praise, I keep coming back to [Ivory](https://tapbots.com/ivory/), which was finally released in the App Store this week. You can only have missed it, though, if you've been living under a rock. Even though I find the development speed of IceCube absolutely remarkable and the app is certainly one of the most impressive in terms of features, I am still bothered by the many small bugs and especially the bad scrolling performance. (I think SwiftUI might be the one to blame here.) Ivory, on the other hand, is really fast and performant. The great thing is that you can change at any time.\n-  🕹️ I've played the two new **playdate games** that were released for me this week: [Flipper Lifter](https://play.date/games/flipper-lifter/) and [Echoic Memory](https://play.date/games/echoic-memory/). I am really bad at audio and don't know if I enjoy Echoic Memory and I haven't found any access to Flipper Lifter yet. In general, with some playdate games, I sometimes feel like I don't really understand the mechanics of the game, and just do anything that will somehow get me to the goal. I sometimes wish the games would introduce you a little more and not leave you completely out in the cold. \n- 🕹️ In the end, everything was overshadowed by the fact that my **playdate** probably **has** a **faulty battery**. I have, surprisingly unexpectedly, received an answer from [Cabel](https://social.panic.com/@cabel/109757052741921514), but unfortunately not yet from support. They seem to be quite overwhelmed by support requests right now.\n- 📱 On **iOS**, I looked at [Countdown to Anything!](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1489443070) but I think I'll stick with [Countdowns](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/countdowns-termine-verfolgen/id917514700). \n- 📱 This [screenshot](https://social.lol/@inkeduprunner/109744118273037005) of Jason's homescreen inspired me to tinker a little bit with [Widgy](https://social.lol/@inkeduprunner/109744118273037005). I also bought [Opener](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/opener-open-links-in-apps/id989565871), don't know why 😇\n- 💻 On the **Mac**, I've been looking at the new [Arc](https://thebrowser.company) browser, which is kind of hyped right now. I really don't know why though. I have a bit of a suspicion that it might just be the invite system. To me, the browser seems extremely sluggish. My password management and Apple Pay don't work, which is probably not the browser's fault. It's too early to judge, but so far I always go back to Safari after a short time. \n- 💻 It came to my mind, that you can use Markdown links of [hooked](https://mastodon.cloud/@cogsciapps/109758770719895321) items together with [One Thing](https://sindresorhus.com/one-thing), an App that I really enjoy. It gives you one click menu bar item to the one file you are just working on.\n- 💻 I had a look at [HiDock, for Mac](https://hidock.app/) and [Lasso - Window Manager for macOS](https://thelasso.app/).\n- 💻 Thanks to [Matthew](https://social.lol/@mken/109750124058233654) I became aware of [Menubar X](https://menubarx.app) ([Setapp](https://setapp.com/de/apps/menubarx)). This works pretty well together with [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) / [DeepL Write](https://www.deepl.com/write) and [elk.zone](https://elk.zone/).\n- ✅ I've moved all my todo item for work from [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) to Apple's Reminders app. I want to see if I can separate them enough thanks to smart lists and tags. The only thing I miss so far is the ability to filter by focus modes, like it is possible with Calendars, etc. Only Apple knows why this is not possible yet, I guess.\n- ❤️ Thanks to [Faisal Misle](https://social.lol/@faisal/109750741237166481), I now also know that you can publish to the omg.lol weblog via [github](https://github.com/neatnik/weblog.lol). I have no idea about all these things, but thanks to the many great tutorials, even I managed to do it. Speaking of [omg.lol](https://omg.lol) and how clueless I am about all this internet stuff, I managed to change my [status.log](https://esamecar.status.lol) via the [API](https://api.omg.lol/), again thanks to the awesome docs. I control this with a Shortcuts shortcut and can trigger it from my [Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/) and [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/).

A podcast I did not know about before. This was a very intimate conversation and I discovered so much of myself in what was told. Unfortunately, I can't even begin to speak with such reflection and eloquence. There's definitely a reason I'm not a podcaster, and an absolutely insignificant little fish otherwise. What I also found very interesting was <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+B7ND0zcCY\">The Talk Show: ‘Slow-Moving Hurricane’, With Craig Hockenberry</a>. I only knew Craig Hockenberry from <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@chockenberry\">his posts and profile picture</a>. I was very surprised to listen to such a level-headed, reflective person. It's always exciting what impressions you get about people just by reading about them or listening to them. The episode <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+6u81QBHHQ\">Really Specific Stories: Jason Burk</a> fit in very well with this. I'm already looking forward to the others.</li>\n<li>🎙️ Parallel to the release of the two new games <a href=\"https://play.date/games/lost-your-marbles/\">Lost Your Marbles</a> and <a href=\"https://play.date/games/pickpackpup/\">Pick Pack Pup</a> in Series 1 for <a href=\"https://esamecar.net/2023/01/07/playdate.html\">my playdate</a> I listened to the respective podcast episodes: <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+5Ddo1eC7M\">Playdate Podcast: Pick Pack Pup</a> and <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+5DdrMprw0\">Playdate Podcast: Lost Your Marbles</a>. </li>\n<li>🎙️ Additionally I've listened to <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+Fcm_P4vGY\">Upgrade: 441: Qi2: Qi Harder</a>, <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+I5CmMcSjU\">AppStories: Read-Later Apps</a>, <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+Fcm-buxIs\">Upgrade: 442: Zombie Arms and Toaster Fridge</a>, <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+FgnYjcuX0\">Under the Radar: 260: Subscription School</a> and <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+FXx6P7vZI\">Connected: 433: The Best Alarm is the Alarm</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For these posts, I was looking for a way to log the podcast episodes I was listening to, but couldn't find a way to look them up in <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/\">Overcast</a>. So I wrote a Shortcuts script that logs the currently playing episode to a Drafts document after 30 seconds.</li>\n<li>🥘 Speaking of the Shortcuts app. I love <a href=\"https://mela.recipes\">Mela</a> and in my family we use <a href=\"https://www.ponlist.de\">Pon</a> for shopping lists. Unfortunately, there is no way to export shopping lists directly from Mela to Pon. And it is not possible to import the corresponding Reminders list into Pon. So I put together a little <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/9c1fa9b21f574dfd81d65e8ae55e8305\">shortcut</a> that somehow does the job.</li>\n<li>❤️ I was playing around with my <a href=\"https://now.esamecar.net\">omg/now</a> page.</li>\n<li>💻 I bought <a href=\"https://www.houdah.com/photosWorkbench/\">Photos Workbench</a>. I think I will mainly use it to compare and select pictures. I really miss a corresponding function in the Photos app. I have looked a lot for alternatives and had even subscribed to Lightroom in the meantime. But that's a complete overkill and I don't want to have any more software from that company. That's why I'm happy that an app has now been released that will hopefully take care of that.</li>\n<li>🕹️ Played <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/pick-pack-pup/3030-82889/\">Pick Pack Pup (2022)</a> and the first ten levels of <a href=\"https://social.lol/@esamecar/109727415412705797\">Gravity Express</a>. The former is fine but I did not fell in love so far. The latter ist very similar to <a href=\"https://possiblyaxolotl.itch.io/rocketbytes\">Rocket Bytes</a> but Gravity Express has checkpoints, tasks, fuel, etc. I seems not that hardcore as the other.</li>\n<li>🗼Stumbled across <a href=\"https://lantern.rknight.me\">Lantern</a>. </li>\n<li>Bought <a href=\"https://mstdn.plus/@lapcatsoftware/109718227833446585\">Homecoming for Mastodon</a>.

Unlike many others, I'm not warming up to the app. It has too many little bugs that make it hard for me to use it regularly. But of course, the whole <a href=\"https://social.lol/@esamecar/109717531311835254\">App Store approval saga</a> was funny - or rather the opposite.</li>\n<li>🎙️<a href=\"https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper/large\">MacWhisper</a>: It's absolutely impressive what's now possible.</li>\n<li>💬 Too much <a href=\"https://social.lol/@esamecar\">Mastodon</a> but I really like it there.

Unfortunately, I can't even begin to speak with such reflection and eloquence. There's definitely a reason I'm not a podcaster, and an absolutely insignificant little fish otherwise. What I also found very interesting was [The Talk Show: ‘Slow-Moving Hurricane’, With Craig Hockenberry](https://overcast.fm/+B7ND0zcCY).

I'd rather not know how many emails I've missed because of this. 🤯 At least, I think, I've resolved the issue: Under <a href=\"http://icloud.com\">icloud.com</a> / Mail / Settings / Accounts I’ve disabled the Alias addresses, filled in Fullname and Label, renabled the Account alias and now it’s working again.\n\n\n## 2023-01-25\n### Apple Mail (macOS 13.1)\n\nOf course, it would be nice if Apple Mail would also show me my emails.\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/95406/2023/7fe26434ec.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Apple Mail not showing the selected mail.\" title=\"CleanShot 2023-01-25 at 09.31.34.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"596\" height=\"212\" />\n\n### Home Screen (iOS 16.2)\n\nAh, not only does the lock screen not want to show widgets all the time, the (Files.app) widget on the home screen can also be empty.\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/95406/2023/a81e9280f8.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot iOS home screen with blank Files.app widget\" title=\"IMG_8231.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"139\" height=\"300\" />\n\n### App Store (iOS 16.2)\n\nWhy not give us even more sorting options for subscriptions?

It told me that I don't have Xcode CLI tools installed and asked me to do so. I already had but, yeah, anyhow, I did it via the given shell command ... A few minutes later macOS tells me that there a two updates available. \n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/95406/2023/9df68b44a0.png\" alt=\"Screenshot Updates available - CLI Tools Xcode\" title=\"updates_cli_xcode.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"299\" height=\"69\" />\n\nWTF? Why two versions? And why an update anyways, I just downloaded them directly from Apple?\n\n### Shortcuts\nThe Apple Shortcuts App constantly gets out of sync between my MacBook and my iPhone. Thanks!\n\n\n### Reminders\nWhy does adding reminders via Siri work without any problems under iOS and exactly the same request via Siri under macOS leads to absolutely pointless queries and error messages (at least when set to GER)? WTF?\n",

I've installed [irssi](https://irssi.org/) via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), was able to connect, but failed with its operation. I'll have to look at it again some other time. Even though I am not a fan of, I understand very well why [Discord](https://discord.com) etc. have become famous 🤦‍♂️\n- 🍩 I've 3Dprinted some small things, primarily for household or work purposes, such as an [iPad Stand](https://www.printables.com/de/model/96617-ipad-stand), to use it as a second monitor at work and a [tea bag drainer](https://www.printables.com/de/model/295408-tea-bag-drainer-v2/files). And of course things for my AnkerMake M5 itself, like [Spare Parts Box](https://www.printables.com/de/model/304873-ankermake-m5-spare-parts-box/files) and [Accessory Bins](https://www.printables.com/model/345230-accessory-bins-for-ankermake-m5). (I was already afraid that this is another hobby that is only concerned with itself. In other words, you do things with it that you only do because you now have this thing that does things ... You understand me.)\n- 🤯 For me, I still haven't been able to conclusively determine on which platform I want to follow whom and where I want to post something and how. The interoperability of the fedivers (micro.blog <-> mastodon together with RSS etc.) is ingenious, but it also leads to a lot of friction and redundancy at least for me. I definitely need to get better at this. In all the experimenting I've been doing over the last few days, I've often had the problem of finding the exact URL of an RSS feed. To achive this via Reeder or similar was too cumbersome  for me and the times when the browser I use simply displayed the feeds prominently are also long gone. I have therefore created an iOS/macOS [shortcuts](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/fcaa7a4964ff4c078a6a13047a59fdfe). I'm not good at it, but it does the job I hope.\n- 👨‍💻 Oh, I almost forgot. The battery on my private Intel MacBook Pro was dead. I had it replaced. It cost me € 229 - not exactly cheap. But the whole thing, including sending it in (to the Czech Republic, repair and return) took less than three days 👏. However, I got a new top case with a new keyboard etc., which probably wasn't a bad idea for that model. Since it had already been in use for several years, I decided to completely rebuild it. I would have preferred to save myself the experience. So many little macOS (iCloud) bugs in the process really annoyed me and the new system settings are hell.\n\n🙋‍♂️\n",

Also available via [Setapp](https://setapp.com/).\n\n- [Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/): <em>\"Mind-blowing emoji on your Mac.\"</em> I really enjoy using this emoji picker. Tried using the one from Recast but went back to Rocket.\n\n- [Quitall](https://amicoapps.com/app/quitall/): <em>\"Before you Force Quit, QuitAll. A fresh start without a restart.\"</em> If it wasn't included in my [Setapp](https://setapp.com/) subscription I probably would not have bought it. I know it's a bad habit under macOS to quit apps but sometimes I have so many of them open, that I prefer a fresh start. That's were Quintal comes into play.\n\n- [Hookmark](https://hookproductivity.com): <em>\"Search Less. Focus more.\"</em> If you haven't heart of Hookmark yet, go and check it out. It's really awesome and I wish something like this was build directly into macOS. You can more or less interlink everything. Also available via [Setapp](https://setapp.com/).\n\n- And of course there are some productivity apps I mainly use for work <a href=\"https://kapeli.com/dash\">Dash</a>, <a href=\"https://www.devontechnologies.com/\">DevonThink</a>, <a href=\"https://stclairsoft.com/DefaultFolderX/\">Default Folder X</a>, <a href=\"https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/\">Keyboard Maestro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.noodlesoft.com/\">Hazel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.econtechnologies.com/chronosync/overview.html\">ChronoSync</a>. Maybe I'll write a little more about them later.\n\n- Oh, I would have forgotten about [CCC](https://bombich.com/de): <em>\"CCC does everything you wish Time Machine did (and more!)\"</em> Buy it, use it! (Or [SuperDuper!](https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html) I don't care 😎)\n\n<strong>Update</strong>: <a href=\"https://mb.esamecar.net/2023/01/14/even-more-macos.html\">even more apps ...</a>\n\n",

There, Mammoth also makes a very good impression, but in the end I was lucky and was able to test <a href=\"https://tapbots.social/@ivory\">Ivory</a> via Testflight. The app by <a href=\"https://tapbots.social/@paul\">Paul Haddad</a> and <a href=\"https://tapbots.social/@mark\">Mark Jardine</a> has an button design that is a bit too playful for my taste, but otherwise it is extremely stable and really great at everything it does. The recently added <a href=\"https://social.lol/@esamecar/109653526172609597\">list features</a> are awesome, as they allow certain accounts to be hidden from the home view. So, atm I stick to Ivory and am looking forward to even better builds.</p>\n<p>Then, sometime last week, I came across a <a href=\"https://social.lol/@otaviocc/109607448264194924\">post</a> from <a href=\"https://social.lol/@otaviocc\">@otaviocc@social.lol</a> on <a href=\"https://home.omg.lol\">omg.lol</a>. And then, coincidentally, I signed up for the service with thousands of other people (<a href=\"https://omglol.news/2023/01/07/wildest-36-hours-ever\">who must have read a post on Hacker News</a> and not otaviocc&rsquo;s post 😎).\nOn omg.lol you ultimately get a &ldquo;funny&rdquo; address on the web that contains a wide variety of small services. A single page website (to use as a <a href=\"https://esamecar.omg.lol\">business card</a>), a <a href=\"http://esamecar.status.lol\">statuslog</a>, an omg.lol-email address (forwarder), different DNS services, pastebin, PURL service, a <a href=\"http://esamecar.weblog.lol\">weblog</a> (beta), etc. And while I was at it anyways, I also have my <a href=\"https://social.lol/@esamecar\">Mastodon</a> account moved from mastodon.social to <a href=\"https://social.lol\">social.lol</a>. Luckily that went really smoothly. It was a lot of fun getting involved, configuring everything and thinking about what it&rsquo;s even good for 🤦‍♂️.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, I continued to work with the <a href=\"https://www.ankermake.com/eu-en\">AnkerMake M5</a>, which also arrived after a very long wait at the beginning of December. All in all I&rsquo;m very happy with the 3D printer, but still don&rsquo;t really know what got into me back in early 2022 when I backed it on Kickstarter. But that is definitely going too far at this point and maybe I&rsquo;ll go into more detail elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Well, micro.blog is kind of a universe in itself too. In addition to choosing a <a href=\"https://social.lol/@muhh/109652832580041607\">theme</a>, there is of course the client question. I got some for iOS (the official <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1253201335\">app</a>, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1437753701\">Gluon for Micro.blog</a> and MacOS (<a href=\"https://redsweater.com/marsedit\">MarsEdit 5</a>, which I use via <a href=\"https://setapp.com\">Setapp</a>) looked at various editors (<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ia-writer/id775737172\">iA Writer</a>, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/drafts/id1236254471\">Drafts</a> and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/runestone-text-editor/id1548193893\">Runestone</a>. In addition, there are useful tools as <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696\">Mimi Uploader</a> (iOS) to upload images and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1592173492\">Epilogue for Micro.blog</a> to track books, but I&rsquo;m just starting out here, there are just too many apps and I have to see which ones &ldquo;click&rdquo; for me.</p>\n<p>There are of course all sorts of little helpers for publishing interesting links and posts on Mastodon or blog entries. Among others <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/linky-for-twitter-and-mastodon/id438090426\">Linky</a> and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/re-toot/id1661697436\">Re: Toot</a> by <a href=\"https://social.lol/@simonbs@mastodon.social\">Simon B. Støvring</a> (who, by the way, is also responsible for Runestone) I would like to mention at this point.</p>\n<p>As if all that wasn&rsquo;t enough, at the beginning of last week, after a 1.5 year wait, I received my long-awaited <a href=\"https://play.date\">playdate</a> game console. (In the meantime I had actually already forgotten that I had even ordered it and I was all the happier that it suddenly arrived.) It&rsquo;s a lot of fun to deal with the little yellow box and I wanted to jot down some impressions I got. I rented a domain with Wordpress installed last year already and tried a few things with <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">micro.blog</a> but didn&rsquo;t really publish anything on either platform. This year I wanted to change that and thus started with a <a href=\"https://esamecar.de/2023/01/07/playdate.html\">post about the playdate</a>.</p>\n<p>All in all, it was an exciting time in terms of IT. Now all of a sudden I somehow have <a href=\"https://esamecar.de/2023/01/07/hello-world.html\">three blogs</a> and will soon have to concentrate on one of them and see when everyday work starts again tomorrow, whether I still have the time and, above all, the desire to continue writing down my thoughts, or these escapades were again one of my &ldquo;manic&rdquo; excursions into something new and I would lose interest again the day after tomorrow - which would be a pity.</p>\n<p>So, maybe cu next week 🙋‍♂️</p>\n<p>PS: initally, I wanted to talk a little bit about the music and podcasts I&rsquo;ve listened to, too but this post is already way too long.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>Update 22.01.2023: It <!-- raw HTML omitted -->seems like<!-- raw HTML omitted --> he is not actively developing it right now.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

And then, coincidentally, I signed up for the service with thousands of other people ([who must have read a post on Hacker News](https://omglol.news/2023/01/07/wildest-36-hours-ever) and not otaviocc's post 😎). \nOn omg.lol you ultimately get a \"funny\" address on the web that contains a wide variety of small services. A single page website (to use as a [business card](https://esamecar.omg.lol)), a [statuslog](http://esamecar.status.lol), an omg.lol-email address (forwarder), different DNS services, pastebin, PURL service, a [weblog](http://esamecar.weblog.lol) (beta), etc. And while I was at it anyways, I also have my [Mastodon](https://social.lol/@esamecar) account moved from mastodon.social to [social.lol](https://social.lol). Luckily that went really smoothly. It was a lot of fun getting involved, configuring everything and thinking about what it's even good for 🤦‍♂️.\n\nIn the meantime, I continued to work with the [AnkerMake M5](https://www.ankermake.com/eu-en), which also arrived after a very long wait at the beginning of December. All in all I'm very happy with the 3D printer, but still don't really know what got into me back in early 2022 when I backed it on Kickstarter. But that is definitely going too far at this point and maybe I'll go into more detail elsewhere.\n\nWell, micro.blog is kind of a universe in itself too. In addition to choosing a [theme](https://social.lol/@muhh/109652832580041607), there is of course the client question. I got some for iOS (the official [app](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1253201335), [Gluon for Micro.blog](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1437753701) and MacOS ([MarsEdit 5](https://redsweater.com/marsedit), which I use via [Setapp](https://setapp.com)) looked at various editors ([iA Writer](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ia-writer/id775737172), [Drafts](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/drafts/id1236254471) and [Runestone](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/runestone-text-editor/id1548193893). In addition, there are useful tools as [Mimi Uploader](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696) (iOS) to upload images and [Epilogue for Micro.blog](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1592173492) to track books, but I'm just starting out here, there are just too many apps and I have to see which ones \"click\" for me.\n\nThere are of course all sorts of little helpers for publishing interesting links and posts on Mastodon or blog entries. Among others [Linky](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/linky-for-twitter-and-mastodon/id438090426) and [Re: Toot](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/re-toot/id1661697436) by [Simon B. Støvring](https://social.lol/@simonbs@mastodon.social) (who, by the way, is also responsible for Runestone) I would like to mention at this point.\n\nAs if all that wasn't enough, at the beginning of last week, after a 1.5 year wait, I received my long-awaited [playdate](https://play.date) game console. (In the meantime I had actually already forgotten that I had even ordered it and I was all the happier that it suddenly arrived.) It's a lot of fun to deal with the little yellow box and I wanted to jot down some impressions I got. I rented a domain with Wordpress installed last year already and tried a few things with [micro.blog](https://micro.blog) but didn't really publish anything on either platform. This year I wanted to change that and thus started with a [post about the playdate](https://esamecar.de/2023/01/07/playdate.html).\n\nAll in all, it was an exciting time in terms of IT. Now all of a sudden I somehow have [three blogs](https://esamecar.de/2023/01/07/hello-world.html) and will soon have to concentrate on one of them and see when everyday work starts again tomorrow, whether I still have the time and, above all, the desire to continue writing down my thoughts, or these escapades were again one of my \"manic\" excursions into something new and I would lose interest again the day after tomorrow - which would be a pity.\n\nSo, maybe cu next week 🙋‍♂️\n\nPS: initally, I wanted to talk a little bit about the music and podcasts I've listened to, too but this post is already way too long.\n\n[^1]: Update 22.01.2023: It <a href=\"https://chaos.social/@343max/109721280698325235\">seems like</a> he is not actively developing it right now.\n\n",

				"content_text": "<h1>What I have done in the first week of 2023  (teaser: mastodon, omg.lol, playdate, ankermake)</h1>\n<p>I was motivated by <a href=\"https://micro.blog/muhh\">muhh</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.byzero.de/2023/01/08/week-its-a.html\">blog entry</a> to write down what was on my mind in the first week of January. I'm not sure yet if this will become something more regular, but I wanted to start putting something online more often anyway - more on that below.</p>\n<p>I've had the last two weeks off. The weather was bad, I had a cold 🤧 and therefore a lot of cycling wasn't an option either (at least that's what I told myself). So, I used the time to hang out at the computer a little more than usally. There was a lot of exciting things to discover there. \nSomehow Elon started this with the downfall of twitter, which he initiated. I had only been there reading for years anyway, and then after the takeover I decided to download my data, delete the clients on my end devices and no longer use the account.</p>\n<p>As an alternative, I was of course interested in Mastodon and clicked an account on the standard instance <a href=\"https://mastodon.social\">mastodon.social</a>. Thanks to tools like <a href=\"https://www.movetodon.org\">movetodon</a> and <a href=\"https://glitch.com/~fedifinder\">fedifinder</a> my timeline has also filled up pretty quickly, and I actually \"met\" pretty quickly some real people with whom you could exchange ideas in a friendly manner. All in all a very positive experience.</p>\n<p>One great thing about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse\">fediverse </a> is the extreme dynamics of the tools and clients that are currently being built around it. It feels like back in the early days of Twitter where, for example, a single programmer, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loren_Brichter\">Loren Brichter</a>, with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweetie\">Tweetie</a> could turn the whole twitter landscape upside down. (BTW he only has an <a href=\"https://mastodon.cloud/@loren\">inactive account</a> on Mastodon 😢) </p>\n<p>I tried countless clients over a few days. Among others (unsorted)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ice Cubes for Mastodon (<a href=\"https://testflight.apple.com/join/tqI3dK1u\">beta</a>) by <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@dimillian\">@dimillian</a> (<a href=\"@icecubesapp@mastodon.cloud\">@icecubesapp</a>),</li>\n<li>Mammoth: for Mastodon (<a href=\"https://testflight.apple.com/join/HyL7boSn\">beta</a>) by <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@JPEGuin\">@JPEGuin@mastodon.social</a>,</li>\n<li>Wolly for Mastodon (<a href=\"https://testflight.apple.com/join/2LVAJQTP\">beta</a>) by <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@mttvll\">Matteo</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mastoot/id1501485410\">Mastoot</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mastodon/id1571998974\">Mastodon</a> (official app),</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/toot/id1229021451\">Toot!</a> (on <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@tootapp\">Mastodon</a>),</li>\n<li>Komondor (beta) by <a href=\"https://chaos.social/@343max\">@343max@chaos.social</a>, and</li>\n<li>Ivory (beta; officially alpha ;-)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The official app is okay, but IMHO not great; toot! I liked the range of functions very much, but you also have to cope with the strange design somehow. Because I follow some accounts that post a lot, and since the timeline on Mastodon is not orchestrated by any algorithms, posts from other people are in danger of being lost. Thats why a good list function is very important to me personally. There, Mammoth also makes a very good impression, but in the end I was lucky and was able to test <a href=\"https://tapbots.social/@ivory\">Ivory</a> via Testflight. The app by <a href=\"https://tapbots.social/@paul\">Paul Haddad</a> and <a href=\"https://tapbots.social/@mark\">Mark Jardine</a> has an button design that is a bit too playful for my taste, but otherwise it is extremely stable and really great at everything it does.

I ordered it in July 2021 and finally received it a mere 1.5 years later. Since then I’ve really enjoyed the console. Every animation, every sound somehow expresses the joy and dedication that Cable Sasser and his team at <a href=\"https://panic.com/\">Panic</a> evidently put into the development of this – while <a href=\"https://shop.play.date/\">rather expensive</a> piece of hardware.</p>\n<p>I really like the first two games of <a href=\"https://play.date/games/\">Series 1</a> so far and they couldn’t be more different. <a href=\"https://play.date/games/whitewater-wipeout/\">Whitewater Wipeout</a> is quite a challenging game of skill in the spirit of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/o_2S5CSc97M \">California Games</a>, which I played with friends for hours on the C64 and immediately brought back fond memories. The game makes very good use of the crank. At first I was happy about 200 points, meanwhile it’s a few thousand and my sons, who grew up with graphically bombastic touchscreen games on iPad and Co. or complex titles on the PS4, also liked it straight away and now fill the high score. However, how you can achieve several million points in this game will probably always remain a mystery to me.</p>\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.racemat.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/CleanShot-2023-01-07-at-12.14.32.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Whitewater Wipeout Highscore on playdate\" border= \"0\" width=\"200\" />\n<p><a href=\"https://play.date/games/casual-birder/\">Casual Birder</a> is „a snap-‚em-all adventure set in beautiful seaside Bird Town“ and also entertaining. However, I haven’t really progressed very far here.</p>\n<p>I’m definitely looking forward to the next 20 games that are included in the purchase price, which also puts it into perspective, and I’m excited for the upcoming <a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch/TW2SHhYw0Vo?t=536\" >store</a> (aka <a href=\"https://playdate-wiki.com/wiki/Catalog\">catalog</a>).</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, you can load your own games and applications onto the device via USB or a website (called <a href=\"https://play.date/account/sideload/\">sideload</a>). A probably almost complete overview of all projects can be found on the <a href=\"https://playdate-wiki.com/wiki/Main_Page\">playdate community wiki</a>. The games are often offered on <a href=\"https://itch.io/games/tag-playdate\">itch.io</a> and usually cost somewhere between $1 and $10.</p>\n<p>So far I’ve been into <a href=\"https://rngpartygames.itch.io/bloom\">Bloom</a>, „a real-time narrative-driven social sim about starting up a flower shop“ and <a href =\"https://possiblyaxolotl.itch.io/rocketbytes\">Rocket Bytes</a>, „a 1-bit precision rocket flying reverse platformer“. The former is just plain nice, the latter hard as hell. Other games I would like to check out are <a href=\"https://ronlent.itch.io/eyeland\">EYELAND</a>, <a href=\"https://gingerbeardman.itch.io /daily-driver\">Daily Driver (Tech Demo)</a> and <a href=\"https://frankbsadgames.itch.io/a-balanced-brew\">A Balanced Brew</a>. And if you have a dollar left over, you can also buy <a href=\"https://kamibox.itch.io/a-joke-thats-worth-099\">A Joke Thats Worth $0.99</a> for a smile.</p>\n<p>As if that weren’t enough, Panic has an app called <a href=\"https://play.date/mirror/\">Mirror</a> that allows games to be streamed and recorded directly to a monitor. <a href=\"https://help.play.date/games/mirror/#key-uses\">Accessibility</a> has also been considered. And then of course there’s the <a href=\"https://play.date/dev/\">development environment</a>, once in professional and as if that wasn’t enough, also a comprehensive <a href=\"https ://play.date/pulp/\">web editor</a>, with which you can develop really professional games in the browser.</p>\n<p>It was also a good thing that I have been the happy owner of an <a href=\"https://www.ankermake.com/eu-en\">AnkerMake M5</a> since December 2022, so I was able to get a suitable <a href=\"https://www.printables.com/de/model/226801-magnetic-cover-for-playdate/files\">Magnetic Cover</a>, because unfortunately I didn’t have the official <a href=\" https://shop.play.date\">ordered</a> and now the shipping would be more expensive than the case itself ;-(</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://www.racemat.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8156-1.jpeg\" alt=\"3d printed magnetic cover for playdate\" title=\"IMG_8156.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"150\" /></p>\n<p>I’m excited to see how the little yellow part will continue, I’m looking forward to regular game updates for the next eleven weeks and at the same time I’ll be listening to the official <a href=\"https://podcast.play.date/\">podcast</a>. Long story short: for me personally a really compelling overall package.</p>\n",
