Yesterday it suddenly stopped connecting to my MacBook Pro (M1). It was listed, but clicking on connect did nothing. I made macOS Ventura forget the device and tried to reconnect it, but to no avail. I shut down the keyboard and rebooted everything, still no luck. I held the power button on the keyboard (no cable to connect with) until it flashed, tried several new batteries, asked the internet and just could not find a solution. </p>\n<p>It turned out that I had to press and hold the power button on my keyboard until it went into pairing mode, and <strong>I had to hold it down throughout the entire setup process</strong>, even while entering the pairing code (it did not even show up with my other approaches, only spinning indicators resulting in dead ends). I am 100% certain that I have never performed such an acrobatic dance to connect a keyboard to a computer before. But maybe I'm going senile.</p>\n",

I took the opportunity to completely reinstall the system. Most of it is now up and running, but <a href=\"https://www.python.org\">Python 3</a> was still missing. Python is a programming language that even I understand to some extent, but the installation is an absolute mess. This time I first installed <a href=\"https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv\">pyenv</a> via <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">Homebrew</a> and then Python. Maybe then the handling of the different versions won't slip through my fingers quite so quickly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python_environment.png\" alt=\"xkcd comic Python Environment\" title=\"xkcd comic Python Environment\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>‚úÖ From time to time, I try to replace certain apps with Apple's own and see if they are now so good that I can do without third-party apps. A few weeks ago, I tried this with task management. I've been a <a href=\"https://culturedcode.com/things/\">Things</a> user since day one, managing both my work and personal tasks. Later, it became too confusing and I wanted to separate work and private tasks. I then used <a href=\"https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus\">OmniFocus</a> for work and Things for my private life. Unfortunately, the Siri integration via the Apple Watch didn't work well, especially because Siri doesn't understand English terms, like \"Things\" on German-language systems. Therefore, Siri never understood to which app I want to add a task to. That's why I gave up on Things a few years ago and used Apple's Reminders app for my private tasks. Thanks to smart lists, tags etc. I thought that I could possibly also manage my professional tasks with Reminders. But two weeks later I realised that this is not yet an option for me. The filter options for the smart lists are too limited, because you can't, for example, include one list and exclude another. Since I don't like the beta of OmniFocus 4 at all so far, I shifted my professional tasks to Things. I like the app a lot and I think I'm happy with the solution again for now.</li>\n<li>üì∫ Started watching <a href=\"https://trakt.tv/shows/star-wars-the-bad-batch/seasons/2\">Star Wars: The Bad Batch: Season 2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/95480\">Slow Horses (2022)</a>.</li>\n<li>üì∫ Continued watching <a href=\"https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/199318\">Bad Sisters (2022)</a> - ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ</li>\n<li>üçø Watched <a href=\"https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/505642\">Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022)</a>.

In addition, I wanted to completely abstain from alcohol for a month. Both worked out well. I'm sticking to meatless dinners and I've also stopped drinking a delicious pale ale or something else during the week. I think that can't hurt in the end. Since this has worked so well, I have come up with two new things for February: no sweets, chocolate, cakes or similar foods with a lot of added sugar. And additionally, no coffee. I had real withdrawal symptoms for the first two or three days (headache, fatigue, slight aching limbs). It's so hard for me to do without a delicious coffee in the morning. But well, there are only a good two weeks left. I don't know yet what nonsense I'll come up with for next month.  ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</li>\n</ul>\n",

After what they said about <strong>software subscriptions</strong>, I&rsquo;m afraid that sooner or later all apps will have to switch to the subscription model.

It&rsquo;s still fun to see all these many ideas for Mastodon clients. There hasn&rsquo;t been so much dynamism in the scene for a long time. Even though <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ice-cubes-for-mastodon/id6444915884\">IceCube</a> gets a lot of praise, I keep coming back to <a href=\"https://tapbots.com/ivory/\">Ivory</a>, which was finally released in the App Store this week. You can only have missed it, though, if you&rsquo;ve been living under a rock. Even though I find the development speed of IceCube absolutely remarkable and the app is certainly one of the most impressive in terms of features, I am still bothered by the many small bugs and especially the bad scrolling performance.

You can only have missed it, though, if you've been living under a rock. Even though I find the development speed of IceCube absolutely remarkable and the app is certainly one of the most impressive in terms of features, I am still bothered by the many small bugs and especially the bad scrolling performance. (I think SwiftUI might be the one to blame here.) Ivory, on the other hand, is really fast and performant. The great thing is that you can change at any time.</li>\n<li>üïπÔ∏è I've played the two new <strong>playdate games</strong> that were released for me this week: <a href=\"https://play.date/games/flipper-lifter/\">Flipper Lifter</a> and <a href=\"https://play.date/games/echoic-memory/\">Echoic Memory</a>. I am really bad at audio and don't know if I enjoy Echoic Memory and I haven't found any access to Flipper Lifter yet. In general, with some playdate games, I sometimes feel like I don't really understand the mechanics of the game, and just do anything that will somehow get me to the goal. I sometimes wish the games would introduce you a little more and not leave you completely out in the cold. </li>\n<li>üïπÔ∏è In the end, everything was overshadowed by the fact that my <strong>playdate</strong> probably <strong>has</strong> a <strong>faulty battery</strong>. I have, surprisingly unexpectedly, received an answer from <a href=\"https://social.panic.com/@cabel/109757052741921514\">Cabel</a>, but unfortunately not yet from support. They seem to be quite overwhelmed by support requests right now.</li>\n<li>üì± On <strong>iOS</strong>, I looked at <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1489443070\">Countdown to Anything!</a> but I think I'll stick with <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/countdowns-termine-verfolgen/id917514700\">Countdowns</a>. </li>\n<li>üì± This <a href=\"https://social.lol/@inkeduprunner/109744118273037005\">screenshot</a> of Jason's homescreen inspired me to tinker a little bit with <a href=\"https://social.lol/@inkeduprunner/109744118273037005\">Widgy</a>. I also bought <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/opener-open-links-in-apps/id989565871\">Opener</a>, don't know why üòá</li>\n<li>üíª On the <strong>Mac</strong>, I've been looking at the new <a href=\"https://thebrowser.company\">Arc</a> browser, which is kind of hyped right now. I really don't know why though. I have a bit of a suspicion that it might just be the invite system. To me, the browser seems extremely sluggish. My password management and Apple Pay don't work, which is probably not the browser's fault. It's too early to judge, but so far I always go back to Safari after a short time. </li>\n<li>üíª It came to my mind, that you can use Markdown links of <a href=\"https://mastodon.cloud/@cogsciapps/109758770719895321\">hooked</a> items together with <a href=\"https://sindresorhus.com/one-thing\">One Thing</a>, an App that I really enjoy. It gives you one click menu bar item to the one file you are just working on.</li>\n<li>üíª I had a look at <a href=\"https://hidock.app/\">HiDock, for Mac</a> and <a href=\"https://thelasso.app/\">Lasso - Window Manager for macOS</a>.</li>\n<li>üíª Thanks to <a href=\"https://social.lol/@mken/109750124058233654\">Matthew</a> I became aware of <a href=\"https://menubarx.app\">Menubar X</a> (<a href=\"https://setapp.com/de/apps/menubarx\">Setapp</a>). This works pretty well together with <a href=\"https://www.deepl.com/translator\">DeepL</a> / <a href=\"https://www.deepl.com/write\">DeepL Write</a> and <a href=\"https://elk.zone/\">elk.zone</a>.</li>\n<li>‚úÖ I've moved all my todo item for work from <a href=\"https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/\">OmniFocus</a> to Apple's Reminders app. I want to see if I can separate them enough thanks to smart lists and tags. The only thing I miss so far is the ability to filter by focus modes, like it is possible with Calendars, etc. Only Apple knows why this is not possible yet, I guess.</li>\n<li>‚ù§Ô∏è Thanks to <a href=\"https://social.lol/@faisal/109750741237166481\">Faisal Misle</a>, I now also know that you can publish to the omg.lol weblog via <a href=\"https://github.com/neatnik/weblog.lol\">github</a>.

(I'll have to think about my work situation in great detail at some point).</li>\n<li>üïπ Playdate: After the two pre-installed games on my playdate, the first two new games included  in Episode 1 arrived for me on Monday: <a href=\"https://play.date/games/crankin/\">Crankin's Time Travel Adventure </a> and <a href=\"https://play.date/games/boogie-loops/\">Boogie Loops</a>. Unfortunately, I'm completely musically untalented, so I haven't looked at Boogie Loops yet, but I despair of Crankin's Time Travel Adventure. As a now completely inexperienced player, I fail grandiosely at this game. For me it is extremely difficult. I just got to level 20 and I was <a href=\"https://social.lol/@phils/109676285675288252\">told</a> that there must be 50 levels. Another game on the list of games I will never play through. <a href=\"https://rngpartygames.itch.io/bloom\">Bloom</a> meanders along. I find it a bit of a pity that in the dialogues there are really only the same statements available, each worded a little differently. I don't feel that you can really influence the story. I'm not 100% sure if I would buy the game again. I had a quick look at <a href=\"https://ronlent.itch.io/eyeland\">EYELAND</a>. However, it doesn't support savegames and so far I haven't felt like trying to tackle it in one go.</li>\n<li>üéß Podcasts: Despite the ones I regularly listen to (<a href=\"https://atp.fm\">ATP</a>, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/\">The Talk Show</a>, <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/automators\">Automators</a>, <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/connected\">Connected</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ridehome.info/show/techmeme-ride-home/\">Techmeme Ride Home</a>) and due to <a href=\"https://esamecar.net\">my</a> recent interest in <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">micro.blog</a> and <a href=\"https://home.omg.lol\">omg.lol</a>, I stumbled upon <a href=\"https://hemisphericviews.com\">Hemispheric Views</a> by <a href=\"https://micro.blog/canion/\">Andrew Canion</a>, <a href=\"https://micro.blog/burk\">Jason Burk</a>, and <a href=\"https://micro.blog/martinfeld\">Martin Feld</a> as well as <a href=\"https://coreint.org\">Core Intuition</a> by <a href=\"https://micro.blog/manton\">Manton Reece</a> and <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@danielpunkass\">Daniel Jalkut</a>. </li>\n<li>üìî I've written a follow up post to my <a href=\"https://esamecar.net/2023/01/12/a-short-list.html\">short list of non-work related macOS apps I really like</a>: <a href=\"https://esamecar.net/2023/01/14/even-more-macos.html\">Even more macOS apps I enjoy using</a> üòé</li>\n<li>üçø I've watched <a href=\"https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/76600-avatar-the-way-of-water\">Avatar: The Way of Water</a> in the cinema with my family. Bombastic, sure, but - as expected - completely irrelevant and above all predictable plot. Still, I didn't regret going to the cinema again.</li>\n<li>üì∫ Together with my wife I finished watching the third season of <a href=\"https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/87917-for-all-mankind/season/3\">For All Mankind</a>. I think I liked it better than the second and I'm looking forward to the fourth.</li>\n<li>ü§ì Because of <a href=\"https://home.omg.lol\">omg.lol</a> , I tried to understand <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat\">IRC</a>.

I think that says it all üòÑ I do pipe a lot of stuff to Day One with the help of [ifttt](https://ifttt.com).\n- [Bartender 4](https://www.macbartender.com/): _\"Bartender is an award-winning app for macOS that superpowers your menu bar, giving you total control over your menu bar items, what's displayed, and when, with menu bar items only showing when you need them.\"_ I run a lot of menu bar apps. Therefore this app ([Setapp](https://setapp.com/)) is indispensable for me on my 13\" MacBook üíª. Speaking of menu bar apps:\n- [Coca](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/coca/id1000808993?mt=12): _\"Coca is a tiny app that puts an icon in your menu bar. Right-click the icon to prevent your system from automatically going to sleep, dimming the screen or starting screen savers.\"_ Very handy in certain circumstances, e.g. you want that backup / download to finish over night etc. There are lots of similar apps, like [Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12) or [Caffeine](https://intelliscapesolutions.com/apps/caffeine) ‚òï.\n- [AirBuddy](https://v2.airbuddy.app/): _\"Take Control of Your Wireless Devices on macOS.\"_ If you own Air Pods üéß and want to switch from iPhone to Mac, have a look at this utility ([Setapp](https://setapp.com/)). And speaking of music:\n- [NepTunes](https://www.neptunesmac.app/): _\"A desktop accessory that allows you to see and control your music (Apple Music, Spotify) with customizable shortcuts, advanced Last.fm support and beautiful themes.\"_ Any nice app that results in me having to open Apple's music üéµ app less often is a win.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I got some for iOS (the official <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1253201335\">app</a>, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1437753701\">Gluon for Micro.blog</a> and MacOS (<a href=\"https://redsweater.com/marsedit\">MarsEdit 5</a>, which I use via <a href=\"https://setapp.com\">Setapp</a>) looked at various editors (<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ia-writer/id775737172\">iA Writer</a>, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/drafts/id1236254471\">Drafts</a> and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/runestone-text-editor/id1548193893\">Runestone</a>. In addition, there are useful tools as <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696\">Mimi Uploader</a> (iOS) to upload images and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1592173492\">Epilogue for Micro.blog</a> to track books, but I'm just starting out here, there are just too many apps and I have to see which ones \"click\" for me.</p>\n<p>There are of course all sorts of little helpers for publishing interesting links and posts on Mastodon or blog entries. Among others <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/linky-for-twitter-and-mastodon/id438090426\">Linky</a> and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/re-toot/id1661697436\">Re: Toot</a> by <a href=\"https://social.lol/@simonbs@mastodon.social\">Simon B. St√∏vring</a> (who, by the way, is also responsible for Runestone) I would like to mention at this point.</p>\n<p>As if all that wasn't enough, at the beginning of last week, after a 1.5 year wait, I received my long-awaited <a href=\"https://play.date\">playdate</a> game console. (In the meantime I had actually already forgotten that I had even ordered it and I was all the happier that it suddenly arrived.) It's a lot of fun to deal with the little yellow box and I wanted to jot down some impressions I got. I rented a domain with Wordpress installed last year already and tried a few things with <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">micro.blog</a> but didn't really publish anything on either platform. This year I wanted to change that and thus started with a <a href=\"https://esamecar.de/2023/01/07/playdate.html\">post about the playdate</a>.</p>\n<p>All in all, it was an exciting time in terms of IT. Now all of a sudden I somehow have <a href=\"https://esamecar.de/2023/01/07/hello-world.html\">three blogs</a> and will soon have to concentrate on one of them and see when everyday work starts again tomorrow, whether I still have the time and, above all, the desire to continue writing down my thoughts, or these escapades were again one of my \"manic\" excursions into something new and I would lose interest again the day after tomorrow - which would be a pity.</p>\n<p>So, maybe cu next week üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>\n<p>PS: initally, I wanted to talk a little bit about the music and podcasts I've listened to, too but this post is already way too long.</p>\n",

I ordered it in July 2021 and finally received it a mere 1.5 years later. Since then I‚Äôve really enjoyed the console. Every animation, every sound somehow expresses the joy and dedication that Cable Sasser and his team at <a href=\"https://panic.com/\">Panic</a> evidently put into the development of this ‚Äì while <a href=\"https://shop.play.date/\">rather expensive</a> piece of hardware.</p>\n<p>I really like the first two games of <a href=\"https://play.date/games/\">Series 1</a> so far and they couldn‚Äôt be more different. <a href=\"https://play.date/games/whitewater-wipeout/\">Whitewater Wipeout</a> is quite a challenging game of skill in the spirit of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/o_2S5CSc97M \">California Games</a>, which I played with friends for hours on the C64 and immediately brought back fond memories. The game makes very good use of the crank. At first I was happy about 200 points, meanwhile it‚Äôs a few thousand and my sons, who grew up with graphically bombastic touchscreen games on iPad and Co. or complex titles on the PS4, also liked it straight away and now fill the high score. However, how you can achieve several million points in this game will probably always remain a mystery to me.</p>\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.racemat.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/CleanShot-2023-01-07-at-12.14.32.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Whitewater Wipeout Highscore on playdate\" border= \"0\" width=\"200\" />\n<p><a href=\"https://play.date/games/casual-birder/\">Casual Birder</a> is ‚Äûa snap-‚Äöem-all adventure set in beautiful seaside Bird Town‚Äú and also entertaining. However, I haven‚Äôt really progressed very far here.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm definitely looking forward to the next 20 games that are included in the purchase price, which also puts it into perspective, and I‚Äôm excited for the upcoming <a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch/TW2SHhYw0Vo?t=536\" >store</a> (aka <a href=\"https://playdate-wiki.com/wiki/Catalog\">catalog</a>).</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, you can load your own games and applications onto the device via USB or a website (called <a href=\"https://play.date/account/sideload/\">sideload</a>). A probably almost complete overview of all projects can be found on the <a href=\"https://playdate-wiki.com/wiki/Main_Page\">playdate community wiki</a>. The games are often offered on <a href=\"https://itch.io/games/tag-playdate\">itch.io</a> and usually cost somewhere between $1 and $10.</p>\n<p>So far I‚Äôve been into <a href=\"https://rngpartygames.itch.io/bloom\">Bloom</a>, ‚Äûa real-time narrative-driven social sim about starting up a flower shop‚Äú and <a href =\"https://possiblyaxolotl.itch.io/rocketbytes\">Rocket Bytes</a>, ‚Äûa 1-bit precision rocket flying reverse platformer‚Äú. The former is just plain nice, the latter hard as hell. Other games I would like to check out are <a href=\"https://ronlent.itch.io/eyeland\">EYELAND</a>, <a href=\"https://gingerbeardman.itch.io /daily-driver\">Daily Driver (Tech Demo)</a> and <a href=\"https://frankbsadgames.itch.io/a-balanced-brew\">A Balanced Brew</a>. And if you have a dollar left over, you can also buy <a href=\"https://kamibox.itch.io/a-joke-thats-worth-099\">A Joke Thats Worth $0.99</a> for a smile.</p>\n<p>As if that weren‚Äôt enough, Panic has an app called <a href=\"https://play.date/mirror/\">Mirror</a> that allows games to be streamed and recorded directly to a monitor. <a href=\"https://help.play.date/games/mirror/#key-uses\">Accessibility</a> has also been considered. And then of course there‚Äôs the <a href=\"https://play.date/dev/\">development environment</a>, once in professional and as if that wasn‚Äôt enough, also a comprehensive <a href=\"https ://play.date/pulp/\">web editor</a>, with which you can develop really professional games in the browser.</p>\n<p>It was also a good thing that I have been the happy owner of an <a href=\"https://www.ankermake.com/eu-en\">AnkerMake M5</a> since December 2022, so I was able to get a suitable <a href=\"https://www.printables.com/de/model/226801-magnetic-cover-for-playdate/files\">Magnetic Cover</a>, because unfortunately I didn‚Äôt have the official <a href=\" https://shop.play.date\">ordered</a> and now the shipping would be more expensive than the case itself ;-(</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://www.racemat.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8156-1.jpeg\" alt=\"3d printed magnetic cover for playdate\" title=\"IMG_8156.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"150\" /></p>\n<p>I‚Äôm excited to see how the little yellow part will continue, I‚Äôm looking forward to regular game updates for the next eleven weeks and at the same time I‚Äôll be listening to the official <a href=\"https://podcast.play.date/\">podcast</a>. Long story short: for me personally a really compelling overall package.</p>\n",
