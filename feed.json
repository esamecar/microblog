				"content_html": "<p>In continuation of week <a href=\"https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/06/02/what-caught-my.html\">22</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the twenty-third week of 2024:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>🔑 As the Safari integration of <a href=\"https://1password.com/\">1Password</a> is getting worse and worse - at least for me it is so buggy, that I have disabled the Safari extension and moved my passwords to Apple&rsquo;s Keychain<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> - I am looking for alternatives. I actually don&rsquo;t want to store my passwords only with Apple, either. I feel too locked in there. But using 1PW in parallel with iCloud seems weird to me in the long run. So, I looked around and for the emerging passkey front I ordered a <a href=\"https://www.token2.com/shop/product/token2-t2f2-pin-dual-release2-fido2-u2f-and-totp-dual-port-nfc-security-key-with-pin-complexity-feature\">Token2</a> security key, which arrived this week. According to its description, it &ldquo;combines hardware-based authentication, public-key cryptography, TOTP/HOTP, U2F, and FIDO2 protocols to protect your accounts.&rdquo; To make a long story short, this post-password world is still way too complicated for me. OTP/HOTP, U2F, and FIDO2?! 🤯 The token stores passkeys but also 2FA codes, and I never know what exactly where and when. Sometimes passkeys alone are enough to log in, sometimes I have to enter an additional 2FA OTP, sometimes - as with Mastodon - the 2FA seems to be the passkey and I still need a username and PW! For the token2 to work, I have to touch it, enter a 6-digit code on my Mac, and then touch it again. That&rsquo;s much more cumbersome than just putting my finger on the touch ID sensor of my Macbook. On my Mac, I can access the stored passkey (but not all or just the OTP tokens, I dont know) on the token2 only very awkwardly but at least via Chrome&rsquo;s settings page. OTP codes can be accessed via the iPhone app but not the passkeys. WTF?! I don&rsquo;t understand anything. In addition, my most important accounts still don&rsquo;t support passkeys. Parallel to this, the <a href=\"https://protonapps.com\">macOS version</a> of <a href=\"https://proton.me/pass\">ProtonPass</a> was released this week, and the <a href=\"https://account.proton.me/pass/signup?coupon=DPROMO&amp;ref=d-promo-banner&amp;currency=EUR\">annual subscription</a> could be purchased for 10 €. What the heck, I thought, and I purchased it. The Mac app seems, like 1Password, to be an Electron app, and it feels like they just released a web wrapper. It is still far from being a viable alternative. Maybe I have to hope for the rumor mill come true and enjoy Apple&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/apple-standalone-passwords-app/\">standalone password manager</a> starting this fall? Anyway, I could not agree more: <a href=\"https://birchtree.me/blog/a-passwordless-future-needs-portability/\">A Passwordless Future Needs Portability</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🚨 There was a bit of <a href=\"https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/06/05/bartender-alternatives.html\">fuss</a> this week about the app Bartender for macOS, which I have highly appreciated so far. I uninstalled it and have been using <a href=\"https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice\">Ice</a> since a couple of days, as <a href=\"https://apps.icymi.lol/post/ice\">mentioned</a>.

I am actually very happy with <a href=\"https://booktrack.app\">Booktracks</a>, <a href=\"https://gamery.app\">Gamery</a>, and <a href=\"https://tvforecastapp.com\">TV Forecast</a>, but I started testing the app again. I am not yet sure if there is a place for an additional, more general app.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🌐 I also tried <a href=\"https://surfed.app\">Surfed</a> again because I actually find the idea of the app very cool. However, it somehow did not reliably record my history and synchronize it between my three used devices.

				"content_text": "\nIn continuation of week [22](https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/06/02/what-caught-my.html), here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the twenty-third week of 2024:\n\n- 🔑 As the Safari integration of [1Password](https://1password.com/) is getting worse and worse - at least for me it is so buggy, that I have disabled the Safari extension and moved my passwords to Apple's Keychain[^1] - I am looking for alternatives. I actually don't want to store my passwords only with Apple, either. I feel too locked in there. But using 1PW in parallel with iCloud seems weird to me in the long run. So, I looked around and for the emerging passkey front I ordered a [Token2](https://www.token2.com/shop/product/token2-t2f2-pin-dual-release2-fido2-u2f-and-totp-dual-port-nfc-security-key-with-pin-complexity-feature) security key, which arrived this week. According to its description, it \"combines hardware-based authentication, public-key cryptography, TOTP/HOTP, U2F, and FIDO2 protocols to protect your accounts.\" To make a long story short, this post-password world is still way too complicated for me. OTP/HOTP, U2F, and FIDO2?! 🤯 The token stores passkeys but also 2FA codes, and I never know what exactly where and when. Sometimes passkeys alone are enough to log in, sometimes I have to enter an additional 2FA OTP, sometimes - as with Mastodon - the 2FA seems to be the passkey and I still need a username and PW! For the token2 to work, I have to touch it, enter a 6-digit code on my Mac, and then touch it again. That's much more cumbersome than just putting my finger on the touch ID sensor of my Macbook. On my Mac, I can access the stored passkey (but not all or just the OTP tokens, I dont know) on the token2 only very awkwardly but at least via Chrome's settings page. OTP codes can be accessed via the iPhone app but not the passkeys. WTF?! I don't understand anything. In addition, my most important accounts still don't support passkeys. Parallel to this, the [macOS version](https://protonapps.com) of [ProtonPass](https://proton.me/pass) was released this week, and the [annual subscription](https://account.proton.me/pass/signup?coupon=DPROMO&ref=d-promo-banner&currency=EUR) could be purchased for 10 €. What the heck, I thought, and I purchased it. The Mac app seems, like 1Password, to be an Electron app, and it feels like they just released a web wrapper. It is still far from being a viable alternative. Maybe I have to hope for the rumor mill come true and enjoy Apple's [standalone password manager](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/apple-standalone-passwords-app/) starting this fall? Anyway, I could not agree more: [A Passwordless Future Needs Portability](https://birchtree.me/blog/a-passwordless-future-needs-portability/).\n\n- 🚨 There was a bit of [fuss](https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/06/05/bartender-alternatives.html) this week about the app Bartender for macOS, which I have highly appreciated so far. I uninstalled it and have been using [Ice](https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice) since a couple of days, as [mentioned](https://apps.icymi.lol/post/ice). It works flawlessly.\n\n- 🗺️ [Organic Maps: Offline Map on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/organic-maps-offline-map/id1567437057?ign-mpt=uo%3D4) now also supports iCloud sync.\n\n- 📚 [Sequel](https://indieapps.space/@sequel/112564001930067974), the manager for a variety of media, received a [major update](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/sequel-2-3s-magic-lookup-is-a-perfect-example-of-how-apps-should-integrate-ai/). I am actually very happy with [Booktracks](https://booktrack.app), [Gamery](https://gamery.app), and [TV Forecast](https://tvforecastapp.com), but I started testing the app again. I am not yet sure if there is a place for an additional, more general app.\n\n- 🌐 I also tried [Surfed](https://surfed.app) again because I actually find the idea of the app very cool. However, it somehow did not reliably record my history and synchronize it between my three used devices. This led to me not finding the things I was looking for, so I will let the subscription expire at the end of the month.\n\n- 📶 [Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/en/products/littlesnitch/index.html) shows network usage in the menu bar on my work computer. If you are looking for a free alternative for just this function, you can check out [‎Scaler Bandwidth Monitor](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/scaler-bandwidth-monitor/id1612708557?mt=12).\n\n- ⏲️ I have been using [Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/) for a long time, but [Horo - the best free timer app for Mac](https://matthewpalmer.net/horo-free-timer-mac/) from the same [developer](https://matthewpalmer.net) had slipped through my fingers until now.\n\n- 🍏 Apple already announced the [2024 winners and finalists - Apple Design Awards](https://developer.apple.com/design/awards/). Congrats to [‎Crouton: Recipe Manager on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crouton-recipe-manager/id1461650987). (I only wish there was an import feature for [Mela](https://mela.recipes), the app I currently use.) \n\n- 🤖 [I’m Not Anti-AI](https://mihobu.lol/2024/06/im-not-anti-ai) spoke to my soul, and since I'm already mentioning [Michael](https://mihobu.lol/about), I was very pleased with his mention in the [Junited](https://mihobu.lol/junited2024) post 🥰.\n\n- 📸 I [learned](https://toot.cafe/@codepo8/112562828562908837) that on macOS, you can open an image with Quick Look by hitting the Space bar and then just select all recognized text (⌘A) and copy it (⌘C) to your clipboard 🤯.\n\n- 🧸 I had to stop collecting [LEGO](https://brickset.com/sets/ownedby-racemase) sets due to space constraints and definitely must not buy the [Evercade Alpha Bartop Arcade System](https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/06/evercade-alpha-bartop-arcade-system-now-available-for-pre-order).\n\n- 🎮 However, I couldn't prevent myself from acquiring a Nintendo N64 console. Thanks to [2x Line Doubler](https://kaicolabs.com/product/nintendo-n64-line-doubler-hdmi/) and RetroScaler [N64 BlueRetro](https://retroreiz.de/shop/nintendo/nintendo-64-n64/zubehoer-nintendo-64/retroscaler-n64-blueretro-wireless-controller-bluetooth-adapter-fuer-nintendo-64/#) Wireless Controller Bluetooth Adapter, I can now play Mario 64 with my [Nintendo 64 Bluetooth Controller](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-64-controller/). Please don't ask why I don't just do it via Nintendo Switch Online, [EmuDeck](https://www.emudeck.com) on the Steam Deck, or simply my iPhone with [Delta](https://faq.deltaemulator.com) 🤷‍♂️.\n\n- 🎨 Speaking of which: more awesome skins for Delta: [Delta Pocket - Transparent Edition](https://store.seanfletcher.co/l/delta-pocket-gba).\n\n- 📱 And: [Nintendo 3DS Emulator for iPhone Released in App Store With Caveats](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/04/nintendo-3ds-emulator-for-iphone-on-app-store/).\n\n- 🔋 If you don't trust macOS's built-in battery management, don't use [AlDente](https://apphousekitchen.com), and are looking for another application of this kind, you might want to check out [BatFi – maximize your Mac's battery lifespan](https://micropixels.software/apps/batfi). BTW I have decided that the built-in function must suffice for me.\n\n- 🔋 Same topic, different area: [AirBattery](https://lihaoyun6.github.io/airbattery/) - *Get the battery usage of all your devices at once!* I noted it down in case [AirBuddy](https://v2.airbuddy.app) stops working someday.\n\n- 🌐 If you ask nicely, you might be able to test a new web-based feed reader: [An introduction to Sublime Feed](https://vincentritter.com/2024/06/03/an-introduction-to-sublime-feed).\n\n- 💻 [Johnny Decimal](https://commandline.johnnydecimal.com) brings Ellane the command line of macOS. If you want to dive deeper afterward, I can definitely recommend [Take Control of the Mac Command Line with Terminal](https://www.takecontrolbooks.com/command-line/).\n\n- 🛠️ I had planned [months ago](https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/02/03/what-caught-my.html) to finally dive into to the [Gridfinity](https://gridfinity.xyz/) system. Somehow, I never had the time to pick out the right base plates. Thanks to the \"reminder\" from [Marcus](https://digitalcourage.social/@mjaschen/112552631190246734) and the hint about these [baseplates](https://www.printables.com/model/170956-basic-gridfinity-baseplates-cadquery-customizable), I just started with one desk drawer. I already knew it, but oh, how awesome is that! I definitely won't get out of this rabbit hole anytime soon. BTW thanks to [Gridfinity Extended](https://makerworld.com/en/models/481168), you can easily click together all sorts of things with [OpenSCAD](https://seasick.github.io/openscad-web-gui/?https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fostat%2Fgridfinity_extended_openscad%2Fmain%2Fcombined%2Fgridfinity_basic_cup.scad).\n\n- 🎙️ [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/podcasts/) has added two new podcasts to its family. The pilot episodes were entertaining. However, based on their teasers, I honestly expected a little more than using the Reminders backend in Fantastical or playing games on the iPad with a controller to get the hosts out of their [Comfort Zone](https://www.macstories.net/comfort-zone/) 😈.\n\n- 🗣️ German-speaking readers should try the [dialect test](https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/dialekt-test-wir-wissen-woher-sie-stammen-jetzt-noch-genauer-205060715129) from the Swiss Tages-Anzeiger, which has made its rounds on the web. I'm still unsure how they fake it, but the precision of the results is amazing.\n\n- 🇪🇺 This weekend are European elections. Go vote! (And vote for a democratic party!)\n\n- 🍏 Next week is the WWDC. It will not be a bug fix year once again. I hope so much that Apple can resist the urge to integrate pointless AI functions into every little app. (I just want a PDF reader that doesn't mess up my annotations and a more stable system in general 😢.)\n\n- 🙋‍♂️ I've received my fist feedback email to a blog post I wrote. Friendly shout-out to [Darren](https://darren.me)!\n\n- 😮 Apart from that, this week in my filter bubble I learnt once again that we are all just people with feelings and that they can be hurt very quickly. I hope that the apologies were sincere and, above all, that they are accepted. Being able to forgive is also a very important trait in a tolerant community.\n\nHave a great week! 🙋‍♂️\n\n[^1]: whatever they are calling it now\n",

				"content_text": "\nIn continuation of week [21](https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/05/26/what-caught-my.html), here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the 22. week of 2024:\n\n- 🚴‍♂️ This week was relatively quiet in terms of tech-related news, partly because my wife had a bicycle accident in the middle of the week. I have borrowed a car, transported her 100 km from one hospital to the local one, she had surgery, and now she is hopefully recovering quickly at home and will soon be back on her feet (and back on the bike).\n\n- 🌦️ [CARROT Weather](https://mastodon.social/@CARROT/112524771010511872) has been released in version 6.\n\n- 💻 The trick on how to [Get ChatGPT for Mac and skip the waitlist](https://9to5mac.com/2024/05/24/get-chatgpt-for-mac-skip-waitlist/) actually works seamlessly.\n\n- ⏯️ This week, I repeatedly[^1] came across [IINA - the modern media player for macOS](https://iina.io/) - which I amusingly already had in my bookmarks collection but hadn't looked at yet. While I was at it, I finally connected [Transloader](https://eternalstorms.at/transloader/) with [Downie](https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/). BTW: [Papertube](https://papertube.live/) - *Turn any YouTube podcast, TED Talk, or chat into easy-to-read text with real speaker names:* I need to take a closer look at it when I get the chance. And while I'm at it, [cobalt](https://cobalt.tools/) also looks like an interesting service.\n\n- 📝 [pixelgraphix](https://wandzeitung.xyz/@pixelgraphix/112513549637333081) pointed out [Bebop](https://www.jackcheng.com/bebop-design-dev-process/). If [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com) is an overkill (or maybe too expensive) for you, you might be able to quickly and easily push texts to Obsidian with this really nice app.\n\n- 📅 I use [Dato](https://sindresorhus.com/dato), but if you're only interested in the [Week Number](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/week-number/id6502579523?mt=12) in the menu bar, you can install the app of the same name from the same [developer](https://sindresorhus.com/apps) for free.\n\n- 📱 I completely overlooked that there is now a sister application for iOS for [Carbon Copy Cloner](https://bombich.com/ccc-mobile-backup). I need to check it out when I get the chance.\n\n- 🎥 [‎Kino - Pro Video Camera](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/kino-pro-video-camera/id6472380172) from the makers of [Halide](https://halide.cam) has been released. It also looks very promising.\n\n- 🎮 In a quiet moment, I need to take a closer look at this: [Another Majora's Mask PC Port Is Here](https://steamdeckhq.com/another-majoras-mask-pc-port-on-steam-deck/).\n\n- 🎮 I wasn't aware until now that you can even run [Android](https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SteamOS-Waydroid-Installer) on the Steam Deck. I'll keep that in mind until I figure out what I would actually use it for 😎.\n\n- 💻 Recently, I wanted to find out what a specific setting is called in English in macOS System Settings, so I set up a virtual macOS installation with [UTM - Virtual machines for Mac](https://mac.getutm.app/). Wow, that was easy. (Unfortunately, I can't manage to access external USB devices/hard drives yet.) Next, I should get into Docker...\n\n- 🎮 This week, after more than two months, my \"repaired,\" i.e., replaced Playdate arrived. It's now the third one. Maybe this one will last a bit longer 🤞.\n\n- 🎮 I also acquired an old Nintendo N64 console. The picture quality of PAL games on the PAL version of the console is abysmally bad on my LG LED TV. Interestingly, NTSC games, started from the [Everdrive](https://krikzz.com/our-products/cartridges/ed64x5.html), look good 🤷‍♂️.\n\n- 🌐 I was happy to hear from [Adam](https://lubieniebieski.pl/bullets/15/) again.\n\nHave a great week and take care 😇\n\n[^1]: among others at [Markus](https://www.marcusjaschen.de/blog/2024/2024-21/) (blog in 🇩🇪)\n",

For those who aren't totally into retro gaming, dedicated emulators like [Delta](https://faq.deltaemulator.com), [PPSPPP](https://www.ppsspp.org) are probably the much more convenient way to enjoy some old games. Nevertheless, it's wonderful to see that RetroArch now runs on the iPhone and especially on the AppleTV! (I use a dedicated Raspberry Pi with [Batocera](https://batocera.org) or my An[alogue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co/pocket) with its dock for the TV, though.)\n\n- 📑 [‎PDF Squeezer](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/pdf-squeezer/id6478766883) is now also available for iOS.\n\n- 💾 [Carbon Copy Cloner](https://bombich.com/) has been released in version 7, and I took the opportunity to support the developer by purchasing the upgrade.\n\n- 🖼️ If you have an old, currently unused iPad lying around (I've heard there are new ones 😇), you might want to check out [Synced Photo Frame by Re-Frame](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/synced-photo-frame-by-re-frame/id1667679282) and repurpose it as a digital photo frame.\n\n- 🖼️ [Photo Tape](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/photo-tape-connect-images/id1637682813) - *Connect Images*: the app looks like a pretty neat way to simply merge images.\n\n- 🔖 [Plinky](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/plinky-easily-save-links/id1597187737) - *Easily Save Links*: there's another bookmark manager. I just bought the lifetime license for [Anybox](https://anybox.app) and therefore my search (for now) is over.\n\n- ⏳ [‎Time - Ring](https://apps.apple.com/app/time-ring/id6479212418) - the elegant and fun way to count down to your most anticipated events! For those interested who haven't yet paid for [Pinning](https://pinning.app), [Up Ahead](https://upaheadapp.com) (which has [resumed development](https://indieapps.space/@upahead/112456859633684855)), [Countdowns](https://countdowns-app.com), or one of the many other apps and are looking for a simple, free option.\n\n- 🎮 I installed [chiaki4deck](https://streetpea.github.io/chiaki4deck/) on my [Steam Deck](https://www.steamdeck.com/) and can now effortlessly do [PS5 Remote Play](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/remote-play/). However, I fear that someone might empty half the PSN Store with my account, but certain risks have to be taken 😬\n\n- 🎮 Due to the early access release of [Hades II](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/), the [first one](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/) was very cheap, so I bought it for the Steam Deck and started playing it. Actually, I wanted to keep my hands off these rogue-like games, but it's just too good.\n\n- 🌞 Have a great week!\n\n[^1]: That was also the reason why there was no blog post from me last week. I assume almost no one noticed ;-)\n",

Thanks to [Harshil Shah](https://mastodon.social/@harshil/112336437696902565#.) for bringing this to my attention.[^2]\n\n- 🎮 And for all those who have now rediscovered their love for Pokemon thanks to Delta, [BenRiceM](https://mastodon.social/@BenRiceM/112332217934897288#.) has released the appropriate app: [Ketchup for Pokémon](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6477297968?pt=96658924&ct=Mastodon&mt=8).\n\n- 📝 As you might know, I switched from Apple Notes to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) as my main notes app some time ago, but those who still use Apple Notes as their [App Defaults](https://defaults.rknight.me) now have in addition to [NotesOllama](https://smallest.app/notesollama/) another extensions available, [ProNotes](https://www.pronotes.app/), which hopefully further improves working with it.\n\n- 📊 Speaking of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), for those still looking for new plugins, the current episode of AppStories [Obsidian Setup Check-In](https://appstories.net/episodes/380) and the blog post [10 Lesser Known But Super Useful Obsidian Plugins](https://amerpie.lol/2024/04/24/lesser-known-but.html) by [Lou Plummer](https://social.lol/@amerpie) might be worth checking out. Additionally, [Brett Terpstra](https://brettterpstra.com) has released a [plugin](https://github.com/ttscoff/Marked2-obsidian) for his brilliant Markdown Preview App [Marked 2](https://marked2app.com).\n\n- ⌨️ I own a [KeyCue](https://ergonis.com/keycue) license and use the app less than I thought I would. The app is not exactly cheap, but fortunately, there are a number of alternatives for those interested, including [KeyClu](https://sergii.tatarenkov.name/keyclu/support/).\n\n- 🏋️‍♂️ [Donovan](https://mastodon.ie/@donovanh/112331598617823066#.) has released a free [Bodyweight exercises](https://apps.apple.com/ie/app/reps-bodyweight-exercises/id6477761819) tracker for iOS.\n\n- 🍏 [Apple users are being locked out of their Apple IDs with no explanation](https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/26/signed-out-of-apple-id-account-problem-password/) - fortunately, I have not been affected so far.\n\n- 🕹️ I also played a lot of [Dead Cells](https://deadcells.com) on the [Steam Deck OLED](https://www.steamdeck.com/en/oled) this week but couldn't get past the penultimate level. I also briefly looked at [Hades](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/) on the PS5. It looks very nice, but I need to play something other than RogueLi\\[kt]e games before I dive into this. I really long to be able to load a game save to progress in a game.\n\n- 📚 I know I definitely shouldn't do it, but I'm thinking about whether or not I should spend 150 € on a [book](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/the-force-of-creativity-5008878) 🤦‍♂️.\n\n- 🎬 Watched [Sterben](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27165281/), a German movie, in the cinema - very intense 3 hours.\n\n- 🤒 I've been sick with a cold for two weeks now and feel unable to exercise and in general struggling through the day. I'm really looking forward to hopefully getting over this next week.\n\nWishing you a beautiful week! ☀️\n\n[^1]: I've started with SteerMouse and so far have no complaints.\n[^2]: Sorry, I got this wrong on my initial post. Hopefully corrected now.\n\n---\n\n2024-04-29: Fix credentials for Time Machine Icons\n",

It was probably because I was very busy at work and in the evenings, I preferred to relax with a game of <a href=\"https://www.playbalatro.com/\">Balatro</a><sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> instead of surfing the net a lot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🛠️ This week, many things just broke. It started with dishes, not just once, followed by a PS5 controller that wouldn&rsquo;t turn on anymore and got dangerously hot while charging and started to smell. Then, the power supply of the old MacBook simply quit working, a 256 GB USB stick made my Mac crash reproducibly as soon as I tried to access it, the <a href=\"https://social.lol/@esamecar/112128048360997520\">crank handle</a> of my Playdate just broke without any external force<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>, our eCargo bike suddenly refused to go any further (Error E010), the coffee machine at work gave up the ghost, and my knee is broken. Well, it&rsquo;s been messed up for 30 years, it just hurts more this week than usual. I think that&rsquo;s a good sign for next week. It can only get better.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🔄 The developer of <a href=\"https://anybox.app/\">Anybox</a> has released a new app: <a href=\"https://pinning.app/\">Event countdown &amp; up - Pinning app</a>. I was a long-time user of <a href=\"https://countdowns-app.com/\">Countdowns</a> before I switched to <a href=\"https://upaheadapp.com/\">Up Ahead</a> because the latter was much more fun to use. However, there has been no update for over ten months, and I&rsquo;m somewhat reluctant to pay a subscription price for that. I&rsquo;ll take a look at Pinning, although there is no macOS version yet and it also has a subscription model behind it. Otherwise, I should dig out Countdowns again. It works wonderfully, it just doesn&rsquo;t look nice at all.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🎉 <a href=\"https://social.lol/@robb/112122739225364588\">Robb</a> announced that his Podcast Ruminate joined MacStories. Congrats!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🤔 I was curious and also signed up for <a href=\"https://scribbles.page\">Scribbles</a>. I definitely don&rsquo;t need another way to blog, but I kind of like the projects by <a href=\"https://vincentritter.com\">Vincent</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🧩 <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/table-of-contents-for-safari/id1665115607\">Table of contents — for Safari on the App Store</a>: A funny little plugin that does exactly what it promises.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>❤️ I was absolutely impressed that I sent a feature request to the developer of <a href=\"https://www.stclairsoft.com/DefaultFolderX/\">Default Folder X</a> and he replied on the same day that he had implemented the feature and it will be included in the next release.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🐶 Besides, I was pleased that you can now use Siri in German without saying &ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; This solves our biggest mistake in dog training. We chose &ldquo;Hey&rdquo; as a stop signal (&ldquo;no&rdquo;) for our dog, and therefore we could only ask the Homepods to do things via voice very limitedly, otherwise, we would completely confuse our dog every time 😅.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🎮 I&rsquo;ve finished <a href=\"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-mario-land-2-6-golden-coins\">Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins</a> (GB) on my Analogue Pocket and started playing <a href=\"https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_vs._Donkey_Kong\">Mario vs. Donkey Kong</a> (GBA).

				"content_text": "\nIn continuation of week [11](https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/03/18/what-caught-my.html), here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the 12th week of 2024:\n\n- 😴 Actually, this week was a very quiet week in terms of tech-related stuff. It was probably because I was very busy at work and in the evenings, I preferred to relax with a game of [Balatro](https://www.playbalatro.com/)[^1] instead of surfing the net a lot.\n\n- 🛠️ This week, many things just broke. It started with dishes, not just once, followed by a PS5 controller that wouldn't turn on anymore and got dangerously hot while charging and started to smell. Then, the power supply of the old MacBook simply quit working, a 256 GB USB stick made my Mac crash reproducibly as soon as I tried to access it, the [crank handle](https://social.lol/@esamecar/112128048360997520) of my Playdate just broke without any external force[^2], our eCargo bike suddenly refused to go any further (Error E010), the coffee machine at work gave up the ghost, and my knee is broken. Well, it's been messed up for 30 years, it just hurts more this week than usual. I think that's a good sign for next week. It can only get better.\n\n- 🔄 The developer of [Anybox](https://anybox.app/) has released a new app: [Event countdown & up - Pinning app](https://pinning.app/). I was a long-time user of [Countdowns](https://countdowns-app.com/) before I switched to [Up Ahead](https://upaheadapp.com/) because the latter was much more fun to use. However, there has been no update for over ten months, and I'm somewhat reluctant to pay a subscription price for that. I'll take a look at Pinning, although there is no macOS version yet and it also has a subscription model behind it. Otherwise, I should dig out Countdowns again. It works wonderfully, it just doesn't look nice at all.\n\n- 🎉 [Robb](https://social.lol/@robb/112122739225364588) announced that his Podcast Ruminate joined MacStories. Congrats! \n\n- 🤔 I was curious and also signed up for [Scribbles](https://scribbles.page). I definitely don't need another way to blog, but I kind of like the projects by [Vincent](https://vincentritter.com).\n\n- 🧩 [Table of contents — for Safari on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/table-of-contents-for-safari/id1665115607): A funny little plugin that does exactly what it promises.\n\n- ❤️ I was absolutely impressed that I sent a feature request to the developer of [Default Folder X](https://www.stclairsoft.com/DefaultFolderX/) and he replied on the same day that he had implemented the feature and it will be included in the next release.\n\n- 🐶 Besides, I was pleased that you can now use Siri in German without saying \"Hey.\" This solves our biggest mistake in dog training. We chose \"Hey\" as a stop signal (\"no\") for our dog, and therefore we could only ask the Homepods to do things via voice very limitedly, otherwise, we would completely confuse our dog every time 😅.\n\n- 🎮 I've finished [Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins](https://www.igdb.com/games/super-mario-land-2-6-golden-coins) (GB) on my Analogue Pocket and started playing [Mario vs. Donkey Kong](https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_vs._Donkey_Kong) (GBA). The next real Mario game will be [Super Mario 64](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-64/Super-Mario-64-269745.html). I've been thinking a bit about how and on which system I want to play it. I've decided to buy the [Nintendo 64 bluetooth controller](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-64-controller/) and try it on the Switch via Nintendo Switch Online Plus.\n\n- 🎥 We watched [The Shawshank Redemption (1994)](https://trakt.tv/movies/the-shawshank-redemption-1994) (again) with our sons. What a damn good movie.\n\n- 🎸 I was at an [IDLES](https://www.idlesband.com) concert 🤘.\n\nHave a wonderfull week ahead!\n\n[^1]: Somehow I really like the game, although I'm not really into card games otherwise. I'm still failing at the first deck of cards, at the latest at ante 8/8, but what the heck 🤷‍♂️.\n\n[^2]: Thanks to my 3D printer, I was able to print a temporary [replacement](https://social.lol/@esamecar/112129266640076878).\n",

It's easier to stream PS5 games to your phone or even [Apple TV](https://merecivilian.com/playstation-5-games-on-apple-tv/).\n\n- 🤖 But iOS is not the only complicated platform for emulation (frontends). As mentioned last week, [ES-DE](https://es-de.org) was released for Android. The programmer did not get permission to distribute it on the Google Play Store and therefore went to Amazon. They [delisted](https://es-de.org/android-amazon) it too, and he had to move to [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/es_de/). Anyway, it's a bit finicky to set up but runs very well on my Retroid Pocket 2S.\n\n- 🎮 On my Anbernic RG35XX, I stumbled upon [VVVVVV](https://thelettervsixtim.es/index.html). How could I have ignored this for so long?\n\n- 🐸 Came across [Bubble Frog by Timbo Johnson](https://timbojay.itch.io/bubblefrog). It's a lovely little game for the Game Boy, and the developer seems very passionate about his project. You can download it for free on itch.io, and to support him, I backed it on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/timbojay/bubble-frog-a-game-boy-bubbly-adventure).\n\n- 🕹️ BTW, there is a new GBA emulator out there. So, if you collect ROMs and emulators as well, you can get this one: [Hades: A Nintendo Game Boy Advance Emulator v1.0.0 released](https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/s/cuRF9BB6Zf)\n\n- 🏰 Finished [Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3](https://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_Advance_4:_Super_Mario_Bros._3). This took me a while and was really, really hard at the end. Next, I finished [Super Mario Land](https://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_Land). This was the opposite; it only took a few hours. Right now, I am playing [Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2](https://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_World:_Super_Mario_Advance_2).[^1]\n\n- 📚 Even though I'm not 100% convinced that my purchase of a [PocketBook Era](https://pocketbook.de/de_de/pocketbook-era-stardust-silver) was the right decision, I still like the idea of an e-ink reader/tablet. These look really great: [BOOX Note Air3 C and Note Air3 Series](https://shop.boox.com/products/noteair3). I've never heard of them before, and I wonder if they are more performant than normal e-readers.\n\n- 🚴‍♂️ My wife and I went for our first bike ride (55 km) of the year outdoors. The weather was fantastic, and there was a hint of spring in the air. It was beautiful.\n\n[^1]: I've decided to (re)play all the [main Mario games](https://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_(series)#Main_games) in chronological order but don't necessarily stick to the original platform. If there was a remake available for GB\\[AC]\\*, I bought the cartridge and play that version on my Analogue Pocket.\n",

I hope I&rsquo;ll stay firm and wait at least for Gen 2 and not want to buy it as soon as the AVP is available in Germany. However, I still find this video noteworthy: <a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=eOH33sWgds8\">What Reviewers Aren’t Telling You About Apple Vision Pro</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>😤 <a href=\"https://social.lol/@esamecar/111945573099378265\">Gruber&rsquo;s polemics</a> and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/02/eu_rcs_imessage\">European Union bashing</a> are getting on my nerves. I&rsquo;m going to remove him from my RSS reader and podcast player for a while. Maybe then my Watch won&rsquo;t complain about an elevated pulse even though I&rsquo;m not currently training. <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🎶 Last week I mentioned <a href=\"https://www.algoriddim.com/\">algoriddim djay</a>, which now also supports Apple Music, and this week I came across <a href=\"https://mixxx.org/news/2024-02-16-mixxx-2-4-0-features/\">Mixxx</a> in my Mastodon timeline for the first time. (Sorry, I can&rsquo;t find where I saw it right now.) It doesn&rsquo;t seem to support any streaming services, but it is open source and therefore free to try.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🎨 Well, as said I can&rsquo;t make music and I can&rsquo;t draw either, but I found this app interesting: <a href=\"https://astropad.com/product/slate/\">astropad slate</a> - <em>Control your Mac using your iPad and Apple Pencil</em>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🔗 In <a href=\"https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/02/03/what-caught-my.html\">week 5</a> I briefly looked into <a href=\"https://www.witt-software.com/linkcluster/\">Link Cluster</a> but due to its lacking ability to copy links in Markdown format it was no real alternative to <a href=\"https://anybox.app/\">Anybox</a> for me. I sent Link Cluster&rsquo;s developer a feature request and this week version 2.1 was released. Among many other new features, you can now copy MD links but unfortunately there is still no share sheet extension for adding links on iOS. So, still on my watch list but no real alternative to <a href=\"https://anybox.app/\">Anybox</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🖼️ <a href=\"https://lowtechguys.com/clop/\">Clop</a> - <em>Image, video, PDF and clipboard optimiser Copy large, paste small, send fast</em>: There&rsquo;s plenty of software for shrinking, for single images, for <a href=\"https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/\">batch</a> processes or even as a <a href=\"https://github.com/xryul/obsidian-image-converter\">plugin</a> for Obsidian. Clop monitors the clipboard or directories and optimises images and videos. It&rsquo;s also available on <a href=\"https://setapp.com/apps/clop\">Setapp</a>. I will definitely take a look at it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>📸 I don&rsquo;t understand why Apple doesn&rsquo;t offer a way in Photos.app to compare several photos from a series and specifically select the best one. I even briefly subscribed to Lightroom because it offers a brilliant X|Y comparison function. But since I didn&rsquo;t really need most of the other functions, the subscription costs were of course not justifiable. I bought <a href=\"https://www.houdah.com/photosWorkbench/\">Photos Workbench</a>, but I didn&rsquo;t really get along with the app - I have no idea why 🤷‍♂️. For iOS, there is now <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/photoscope-storage-cleaner/id6474432385\">Photoscope - Storage Cleaner</a>, which I will take a closer look at, but of course it won&rsquo;t be able to replace a macOS app.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>📝 <a href=\"https://www.reorproject.org/\">Reor</a> - <em>AI note-taking app that runs models locally</em>: Looks interesting, especially in combination with lots of MD files you already store e.g. in Obsidian, but I don&rsquo;t get the difference between all those LLM available. I have to dig a little bit deeper into this, I guess. I just tried it with TheBloke/DiscoLM_German_7b_v1-GGUF and a sample collection of 5,300 text files and the results were very, very disappointing. Can&rsquo;t recommend it yet.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🤖 Speaking of AI. Google&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction\">Gemini</a> is now supposed to understand books in a fraction of a second and Open AI&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://openai.com/sora\">Sora</a> can now create videos. I can&rsquo;t keep up. Today, I asked <a href=\"http://perplexity.ai\">Perplexity</a> to extract the first 25 hits from a Tier List from a website and the LLM absolutely refused to maintain the correct order. But why start small when you can make <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1arrqpz/funny_glitch_with_sora_interesting_how_it_looks/\">chairs float</a> …</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🗂️ After reading <a href=\"https://social.lol/@robb\">Robb</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://rknight.me/blog/three-months-of-the-johnny-decimal-system/\">Three Months of The Johnny Decimal System</a> I decided to preorder <a href=\"https://hachyderm.io/@johnnydecimal\">Johnny</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://jdcm.al/10-19-concepts/14-build-your-system/14.03-the-decimal-workshop/\">Workshop</a>.

				"content_text": "\nContinuing from week [06](https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/02/12/what-caught-my.html), here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the seventh week of 2024:\n\n- 👌 So, I think I've read and seen enough about the Apple Vision Pro for now. I hope I'll stay firm and wait at least for Gen 2 and not want to buy it as soon as the AVP is available in Germany. However, I still find this video noteworthy: [What Reviewers Aren’t Telling You About Apple Vision Pro](https://youtube.com/watch?v=eOH33sWgds8).\n\n- 😤 [Gruber's polemics](https://social.lol/@esamecar/111945573099378265) and [European Union bashing](https://daringfireball.net/2024/02/eu_rcs_imessage) are getting on my nerves. I'm going to remove him from my RSS reader and podcast player for a while. Maybe then my Watch won't complain about an elevated pulse even though I'm not currently training. [^1]\n\n- 🎶 Last week I mentioned [algoriddim djay](https://www.algoriddim.com/), which now also supports Apple Music, and this week I came across [Mixxx](https://mixxx.org/news/2024-02-16-mixxx-2-4-0-features/) in my Mastodon timeline for the first time. (Sorry, I can't find where I saw it right now.) It doesn't seem to support any streaming services, but it is open source and therefore free to try.\n\n- 🎨 Well, as said I can't make music and I can't draw either, but I found this app interesting: [astropad slate](https://astropad.com/product/slate/) - *Control your Mac using your iPad and Apple Pencil*.\n\n- 🔗 In [week 5](https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/02/03/what-caught-my.html) I briefly looked into [Link Cluster](https://www.witt-software.com/linkcluster/) but due to its lacking ability to copy links in Markdown format it was no real alternative to [Anybox](https://anybox.app/) for me. I sent Link Cluster's developer a feature request and this week version 2.1 was released. Among many other new features, you can now copy MD links but unfortunately there is still no share sheet extension for adding links on iOS. So, still on my watch list but no real alternative to [Anybox](https://anybox.app/). \n\n- 🖼️ [Clop](https://lowtechguys.com/clop/) - *Image, video, PDF and clipboard optimiser Copy large, paste small, send fast*: There's plenty of software for shrinking, for single images, for [batch](https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/) processes or even as a [plugin](https://github.com/xryul/obsidian-image-converter) for Obsidian. Clop monitors the clipboard or directories and optimises images and videos. It's also available on [Setapp](https://setapp.com/apps/clop). I will definitely take a look at it.\n\n- 📸 I don't understand why Apple doesn't offer a way in Photos.app to compare several photos from a series and specifically select the best one. I even briefly subscribed to Lightroom because it offers a brilliant X|Y comparison function. But since I didn't really need most of the other functions, the subscription costs were of course not justifiable. I bought [Photos Workbench](https://www.houdah.com/photosWorkbench/), but I didn't really get along with the app - I have no idea why 🤷‍♂️. For iOS, there is now [Photoscope - Storage Cleaner](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/photoscope-storage-cleaner/id6474432385), which I will take a closer look at, but of course it won't be able to replace a macOS app.\n\n- 📝 [Reor](https://www.reorproject.org/) - *AI note-taking app that runs models locally*: Looks interesting, especially in combination with lots of MD files you already store e.g. in Obsidian, but I don't get the difference between all those LLM available. I have to dig a little bit deeper into this, I guess. I just tried it with TheBloke/DiscoLM_German_7b_v1-GGUF and a sample collection of 5,300 text files and the results were very, very disappointing. Can't recommend it yet.\n\n- 🤖 Speaking of AI. Google's [Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction) is now supposed to understand books in a fraction of a second and Open AI's [Sora](https://openai.com/sora) can now create videos. I can't keep up. Today, I asked [Perplexity](http://perplexity.ai) to extract the first 25 hits from a Tier List from a website and the LLM absolutely refused to maintain the correct order. But why start small when you can make [chairs float](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1arrqpz/funny_glitch_with_sora_interesting_how_it_looks/) …\n\n- 🗂️ After reading [Robb](https://social.lol/@robb)'s [Three Months of The Johnny Decimal System](https://rknight.me/blog/three-months-of-the-johnny-decimal-system/) I decided to preorder [Johnny](https://hachyderm.io/@johnnydecimal)'s [Workshop](https://jdcm.al/10-19-concepts/14-build-your-system/14.03-the-decimal-workshop/). I've been using the basic concept [^2] of the [Johnny.Decimal System](https://johnnydecimal.com/00-09-site-administration/00-index/) for many years (I would claim ten, but I don't know how long it's been around actually), but especially in a work context I eventually hit my limits with the system and am curious if I can apply it even better if I engage with it more intensively.\n\n- 🎮 I spent way too much time with [Batocara.linux](https://batocera.org) this week. I installed it on a Raspberry Pi and a [derivative](https://github.com/rg35xx-cfw/rg35xx-cfw.github.io/releases) of it on the [Anbernic RG35XX H](https://anbernic.com/products/rg35xx-h). Wow, I'm very impressed with what's possible with it. It looks so stunning 🥰.\n\n- 📺 Continued watching [For All Mankind S04](https://trakt.tv/shows/for-all-mankind/seasons/4).\n\n- 😊 My mood was better than last week but not perfect. I hope yours is and have a nice week ahead!\n\n---\n**Update 2024-02-20**\n- Added reason why I don't yet use Link Cluster as my bookmark manager of choice.\n- Added disappointment about Reor.\n\n\n[^1]: Speaking of training, since the beginning of the year I've been doing workouts six to seven days a week (sometimes only for 15 min), of which I ride 5 - 6 times on the trainer (30 - 60 min). It's actually way too strenuous for me, but my FTP at the end of the week attested me a significant jump 🎉 . Now I just need to muster the strength to lose 10 kg. But phew, one thing at a time.\n\n[^2]: Meanwhile, my file storage in Obsidian has also partially merged with the PARA system and is threatening to collapse into chaos.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Continuing from week <a href=\"https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/01/28/what-caught-my.html\">04</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the fifth week of 2024:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>🎮 This week I had to repeatedly curb my nearly uncontrollable urge to buy gadgets I don&rsquo;t need - so far quite successfully. I did not order the <a href=\"https://www.ayaneo.com/product/AYANEO-NEXT-LITE.html\">Ayaneo Next LITE</a> nor pledged the <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ayaneo-flip-world-1st-dual-screen-windows-handheld--2#/\">Ayaneo Flip - World 1st Dual-Screen Windows Handheld</a> on Indiegogo. I definitely do not need more gaming handhelds at the moment, even though I don&rsquo;t own one that supports Windows games yet. My backlog is already long enough, I don&rsquo;t need another platform with even more games that I will never play. <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🕹️ One of the games therein is <a href=\"https://exok.com/games/celeste/\">Celeste</a> for the Switch or Playstation. It <a href=\"https://retrododo.com/celeste-64/\">seems to be an absolute classic</a> and I only know the version for the <a href=\"https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=2145\">pico-8</a>, where it all started. It&rsquo;s really hard and so far I can&rsquo;t even get past the third (or fourth?) screen. Regardless, there is now a version as a homage to the N64 area: <a href=\"https://maddymakesgamesinc.itch.io/celeste64\">Celeste 64: Fragments of the Mountain by Maddy Makes Games, Heidy Motta, Noel, saint11</a>. Unfortunately not yet for the Mac, but in the comments you could already read that it is technically quite possible and probably will come.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🖥️ Speaking of gaming on the Mac: This week <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/death-stranding-directors-cut/id6449748961\">Death Stranding Director&rsquo;s Cut</a> was released. I hadn&rsquo;t dealt with the game so far, I don&rsquo;t know either the original version for the PS4 or the Director&rsquo;s Cut for the PS5. Unlike Resident Evil 4, which recently appeared for Apple&rsquo;s devices, this was an opportunity to get an AAA game for macOS at a reasonable price that I hadn&rsquo;t played before. And wow, I am absolutely impressed by the graphics on my MacBook Pro M2 so far. Holy shit, I mean, wow. So far I was not considering a Mac being able to do such a thing. Whether the actual game will appeal to me, I still have to find out, but as a tech demo it has definitely already picked me up. To be able to play it better, I bought a <a href=\"https://www.8bitdo.com/pro2/\">Pro 2 Controller</a> from 8BitDo. At first I despaired of their product portfolio, <sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> and then I realized that I could have used an old PS4 controller. Well, what can you do. I guess, now I am not only somehow collecting retro handhelds, but also game controllers &hellip;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>⏱️ The release of Death Stranding was well timed, as I finished the story of Diablo IV after about 56 hours of playtime this week. I can note for myself that I always take about twice as long for a game as indicated on <a href=\"https://howlongtobeat.com/game/71960\">HowLongToBeat</a> 🤷‍♂️. My Rogue is now level 49 and I will definitely tackle the end game again, at least until I reach level 50 with her. I enjoyed the game, but Diablo IV did not 100% convince me. At first it overwhelmed me with its complexity and its own language for all the facets of the game. The whole system seems unnecessarily complicated to me and later the gameplay became quiet repetitive. And all this in-game loot box up sell shit really got on my nerves. I mean, you buy a full price game and then you&rsquo;re constantly being thrown  pointless IAPs for up to 150 € in your face. Seriously?! Anyway, in the next few weeks I think I will focus again on Super Marios Bros. 3 (GBA) on my <a href=\"https://www.analogue.co\">Analogue</a> Pocket and look maybe at smaller indie titles on the console at most. Then I see if I enjoy Death Stranding. Maybe I&rsquo;ll understand the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QLq2k22AB0\">trailer for part 2</a> better afterwards?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🎮 BTW what definitely interests me more than a Windows handheld is the now possibly upcoming Switch 2 this year and I found the rumors that <a href=\"https://retrododo.com/ps-vitas-successor-is-reportedly-on-the-way/\">The PS Vita&rsquo;s Successor Is Reportedly On The Way &amp; Compatible With PS4/PS5 Titles</a> interesting, too.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>📱 I also did not give in to my impulse to pre-order a rabbit <a href=\"https://www.rabbit.tech/\">r1 - your pocket companion</a>. I find the r1 very exciting as a concept study. I like the design, which comes from the <a href=\"https://teenage.engineering\">same pen</a> as the <a href=\"https://play.date\">playdate</a>. However, the r1 would not be delivered to Europe until the second half of the year anyways, and if the rumors are true, hopefully a usable AI will also be included in <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/01/tim-cook-apple-ai-ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> in the fall. Ultimately, of course, something like this belongs in the smartphone, and I therefore see the r1 at best as a cute gimmick, without a real future. But that&rsquo;s not a reason not to have fun with a toy, is it?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>💻 If I understood correctly, the r1 uses <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai\">perplexity.ai</a>, about which I have read a lot of good things lately. Therefore, I wanted to take a closer look at this service, but their Cloudflare configuration initially did not want to <a href=\"https://social.lol/@esamecar/111861940258698097\">let me play along</a> with Safari 🤷‍♂️. I don&rsquo;t know what exactly Cloudflare didn&rsquo;t like, the check also came with the Arc browser, but disappeared after some time. I&rsquo;m not really convinced yet, but I definitely need to use the service more to form a final opinion.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🌐 Speaking of <a href=\"https://arc.net\">Arc Browser</a>, I suspect that <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/arc-search/id6472513080\"> Arc Search</a> also uses <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai\">perplexity.ai</a>, especially since it can be configured as the default search engine in Arc. I am still not 100% convinced by the browser, either. It all seems a bit strange and opaque to me (why do I need an account to surf the web?!) <sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup> and I find the browser itself quite sluggish and already a  bit bloated.

Anyway, there were very <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/arc-search-for-iphone/\">enthusiastic reports</a> about Arc Search, but the app hasn&rsquo;t really picked me up yet by now. I will force myself to use it more often in the next few days in order to be able to form a better opinion.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🚀 I stumbled upon this post in my RSS Reader - <a href=\"https://www.blast-o-rama.com/2024/01/30/the-iconfactory-looks-to-launch-project-tapestry-via-kickstarter/\">The Iconfactory Looks To Launch PROJECT TAPESTRY via Kickstarter</a> - and more or less backed the <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iconfactory/project-tapestry\">Early Bird Special</a> immediately: <em>With Project Tapestry, we&rsquo;ll create a universal, chronological timeline for iOS for any data that’s publicly available on the Internet.</em> Who doesn&rsquo;t like the guys from <a href=\"https://iconfactory.com\">The Iconfactory</a> and after the whole Twitter debacle a year ago, I&rsquo;m happy to support the developers. I&rsquo;m curious to see if an app will ultimately come out that I find useful, and if not, at least I was able to follow the development and had access to some nice <a href=\"https://wallaroo.app\">wallpapers</a> for a year 🤷‍♂️. Not coincidentally, <a href=\"https://gloria.social/@rizzi/111856959119832404\">Silvio Rizzi</a> announced his new app a few days later: <em>A new app, completely rebuilt and rethought from the ground up.

In January, I started with giving up alcohol and today I realized that it is already February. My problem now is that all the things I had thought of not doing for February, I have already done in the last three days 🤦‍♂️. Now what?! I think I just have to spend February without consuming alcohol as well and prepare better for March 🤣 On my list of ideas is also &ldquo;A month without a smartphone&rdquo; or &ldquo;A month without an Apple Watch&rdquo;. That seems too crazy to me right now, and maybe I&rsquo;ll combine it into a &ldquo;A month less gadgets&rdquo; and give up my iPhone or my watch for &ldquo;only&rdquo; a week each, like Arne did with his <a href=\"https://arne.me/articles/i-lived-7-days-without-a-smartphone\">phone</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>😂 When I read this, I had to laugh a lot:<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup> <a href=\"https://www.heise.de/news/Deutsche-Bahn-sucht-Admin-fuer-Windows-3-11-for-Workgroups-9611543.html\">Deutsche Bahn sucht Admin für Windows 3.11 for Workgroups</a>, which means &ldquo;Deutsche Bahn is looking for an Admin for Windows 3.11 for Workgroups&rdquo; and immediately thought of <a href=\"https://norden.social/@racemase/111341692772365841\">my photo</a> which I took in one of our, oh so modern, ICE trains last November.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>📚 I stumbled upon this at <a href=\"https://heydingus.net/blog/2024/1/7-things-this-week-129\">Hey Dingus</a>: <a href=\"https://www.perry.qa/morse\">Learn Morse Code</a>.

				"content_text": "\nContinuing from week [04](https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/01/28/what-caught-my.html), here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the fifth week of 2024:\n\n- 🎮 This week I had to repeatedly curb my nearly uncontrollable urge to buy gadgets I don't need - so far quite successfully. I did not order the [Ayaneo Next LITE](https://www.ayaneo.com/product/AYANEO-NEXT-LITE.html) nor pledged the [Ayaneo Flip - World 1st Dual-Screen Windows Handheld](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ayaneo-flip-world-1st-dual-screen-windows-handheld--2#/) on Indiegogo. I definitely do not need more gaming handhelds at the moment, even though I don't own one that supports Windows games yet. My backlog is already long enough, I don't need another platform with even more games that I will never play. [^1]\n\n- 🕹️ One of the games therein is [Celeste](https://exok.com/games/celeste/) for the Switch or Playstation. It [seems to be an absolute classic](https://retrododo.com/celeste-64/) and I only know the version for the [pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=2145), where it all started. It's really hard and so far I can't even get past the third (or fourth?) screen. Regardless, there is now a version as a homage to the N64 area: [Celeste 64: Fragments of the Mountain by Maddy Makes Games, Heidy Motta, Noel, saint11](https://maddymakesgamesinc.itch.io/celeste64). Unfortunately not yet for the Mac, but in the comments you could already read that it is technically quite possible and probably will come.\n\n- 🖥️ Speaking of gaming on the Mac: This week [Death Stranding Director's Cut](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/death-stranding-directors-cut/id6449748961) was released. I hadn't dealt with the game so far, I don't know either the original version for the PS4 or the Director's Cut for the PS5. Unlike Resident Evil 4, which recently appeared for Apple's devices, this was an opportunity to get an AAA game for macOS at a reasonable price that I hadn't played before. And wow, I am absolutely impressed by the graphics on my MacBook Pro M2 so far. Holy shit, I mean, wow. So far I was not considering a Mac being able to do such a thing. Whether the actual game will appeal to me, I still have to find out, but as a tech demo it has definitely already picked me up. To be able to play it better, I bought a [Pro 2 Controller](https://www.8bitdo.com/pro2/) from 8BitDo. At first I despaired of their product portfolio, [^5] and then I realized that I could have used an old PS4 controller. Well, what can you do. I guess, now I am not only somehow collecting retro handhelds, but also game controllers ...\n\n- ⏱️ The release of Death Stranding was well timed, as I finished the story of Diablo IV after about 56 hours of playtime this week. I can note for myself that I always take about twice as long for a game as indicated on [HowLongToBeat](https://howlongtobeat.com/game/71960) 🤷‍♂️. My Rogue is now level 49 and I will definitely tackle the end game again, at least until I reach level 50 with her. I enjoyed the game, but Diablo IV did not 100% convince me. At first it overwhelmed me with its complexity and its own language for all the facets of the game. The whole system seems unnecessarily complicated to me and later the gameplay became quiet repetitive. And all this in-game loot box up sell shit really got on my nerves. I mean, you buy a full price game and then you're constantly being thrown  pointless IAPs for up to 150 € in your face. Seriously?! Anyway, in the next few weeks I think I will focus again on Super Marios Bros. 3 (GBA) on my [Analogue](https://www.analogue.co) Pocket and look maybe at smaller indie titles on the console at most. Then I see if I enjoy Death Stranding. Maybe I'll understand the [trailer for part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QLq2k22AB0) better afterwards?\n\n- 🎮 BTW what definitely interests me more than a Windows handheld is the now possibly upcoming Switch 2 this year and I found the rumors that [The PS Vita's Successor Is Reportedly On The Way & Compatible With PS4/PS5 Titles](https://retrododo.com/ps-vitas-successor-is-reportedly-on-the-way/) interesting, too.\n\n- 📱 I also did not give in to my impulse to pre-order a rabbit [r1 - your pocket companion](https://www.rabbit.tech/). I find the r1 very exciting as a concept study. I like the design, which comes from the [same pen](https://teenage.engineering) as the [playdate](https://play.date). However, the r1 would not be delivered to Europe until the second half of the year anyways, and if the rumors are true, hopefully a usable AI will also be included in [iOS 18](https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/01/tim-cook-apple-ai-ios-18/) in the fall. Ultimately, of course, something like this belongs in the smartphone, and I therefore see the r1 at best as a cute gimmick, without a real future. But that's not a reason not to have fun with a toy, is it?\n\n- 💻 If I understood correctly, the r1 uses [perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai), about which I have read a lot of good things lately. Therefore, I wanted to take a closer look at this service, but their Cloudflare configuration initially did not want to [let me play along](https://social.lol/@esamecar/111861940258698097) with Safari 🤷‍♂️. I don't know what exactly Cloudflare didn't like, the check also came with the Arc browser, but disappeared after some time. I'm not really convinced yet, but I definitely need to use the service more to form a final opinion.\n\n- 🌐 Speaking of [Arc Browser](https://arc.net), I suspect that [ Arc Search](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/arc-search/id6472513080) also uses [perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai), especially since it can be configured as the default search engine in Arc. I am still not 100% convinced by the browser, either. It all seems a bit strange and opaque to me (why do I need an account to surf the web?!) [^2] and I find the browser itself quite sluggish and already a  bit bloated. I also don't know what to make of this [Act II](https://www.macstories.net/news/the-browser-company-announces-act-ii-for-arc-the-browser-that-browses-for-you/). Anyway, there were very [enthusiastic reports](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/arc-search-for-iphone/) about Arc Search, but the app hasn't really picked me up yet by now. I will force myself to use it more often in the next few days in order to be able to form a better opinion.\n\n- 🚀 I stumbled upon this post in my RSS Reader - [The Iconfactory Looks To Launch PROJECT TAPESTRY via Kickstarter](https://www.blast-o-rama.com/2024/01/30/the-iconfactory-looks-to-launch-project-tapestry-via-kickstarter/) - and more or less backed the [Early Bird Special](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iconfactory/project-tapestry) immediately: *With Project Tapestry, we'll create a universal, chronological timeline for iOS for any data that’s publicly available on the Internet.* Who doesn't like the guys from [The Iconfactory](https://iconfactory.com) and after the whole Twitter debacle a year ago, I'm happy to support the developers. I'm curious to see if an app will ultimately come out that I find useful, and if not, at least I was able to follow the development and had access to some nice [wallpapers](https://wallaroo.app) for a year 🤷‍♂️. Not coincidentally, [Silvio Rizzi](https://gloria.social/@rizzi/111856959119832404) announced his new app a few days later: *A new app, completely rebuilt and rethought from the ground up. This probably won’t replace the current Reeder (not going away) for a lot of users.* He also didn't miss the opportunity to show Project Tapestry directly in his screenshot 😈.\n\n- 🧹 This little app from [Gui Rambo](https://mastodon.social/@_inside) *helps you clean your Mac's keyboard and trackpad*: [CleanupBuddy](https://cleanupbuddy.app/).\n\n- 📎 As announced [last week](https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/01/28/what-caught-my.html), I took a look at [Link Cluster](https://www.witt-software.com/linkcluster/) - *Collect and manage links*. In principle, I like the app, but it yet lacks the ability to copy links as Markdown links, and that alone is a reason for me to stick with [Anybox](https://anybox.app/) for now. Therefore, I have not yet bought the full version and cannot assess how Link Cluster handles large bookmark collections. But I will definitely continue to follow the development of the app.\n\n- 🎥 I stumbled upon this at the beginning of the week on [Waxy.org](https://waxy.org) and am surprised that it is still online: [ASCII Theater](https://ascii.theater/) - *stream free-text-based movies-in your-terminal*.\n\n- I was very happy and honoured that [Michael](https://social.lol/@mihobu) included my little site in his [blogroll](https://mihobu.lol/blogroll). I also enjoy reading his posts a lot, so its mutual. I also need to revise my own [blogroll](https://mb.esamecar.net/blogroll/), I just have to find the time to do it.\n\n- 📵 At the beginning of the year, I had resolved to give up certain things for a few months, each for a month. In January, I started with giving up alcohol and today I realized that it is already February. My problem now is that all the things I had thought of not doing for February, I have already done in the last three days 🤦‍♂️. Now what?! I think I just have to spend February without consuming alcohol as well and prepare better for March 🤣 On my list of ideas is also \"A month without a smartphone\" or \"A month without an Apple Watch\". That seems too crazy to me right now, and maybe I'll combine it into a \"A month less gadgets\" and give up my iPhone or my watch for \"only\" a week each, like Arne did with his [phone](https://arne.me/articles/i-lived-7-days-without-a-smartphone).\n\n- 😂 When I read this, I had to laugh a lot:[^3] [Deutsche Bahn sucht Admin für Windows 3.11 for Workgroups](https://www.heise.de/news/Deutsche-Bahn-sucht-Admin-fuer-Windows-3-11-for-Workgroups-9611543.html), which means \"Deutsche Bahn is looking for an Admin for Windows 3.11 for Workgroups\" and immediately thought of [my photo](https://norden.social/@racemase/111341692772365841) which I took in one of our, oh so modern, ICE trains last November.\n\n- 📚 I stumbled upon this at [Hey Dingus](https://heydingus.net/blog/2024/1/7-things-this-week-129): [Learn Morse Code](https://www.perry.qa/morse). I would also like to learn something like this. But first, I should probably start refreshing the tying of various [knots](https://www.animatedknots.com/).\n\n- 🍪 I printed a very large [Oreo cookie](https://www.printables.com/de/model/658952-giant-oreo-container). It weighs (not just a feeling) a good half kilogram, consists of six parts, has hardly any space inside but is absolutely awesome. In addition, I printed a [HomePod Mini stand](https://www.printables.com/de/model/56004-homepod-mini-stand) for ours in the kitchen. This way it might survive a disaster better. I also like this [Apple Watch Stand](https://www.printables.com/de/model/518689-apple-watch-stand) and while I was at it, I also printed [SNES Cartridge Holder (PAL)](https://www.printables.com/de/model/423218-snes-cartridge-holder-pal) and the [N64 Single Cartridge Display Stand](https://www.printables.com/de/model/512566-n64-single-cartridge-display-stand) for my Super Mario cartridges.\n\n- 🖨️ The next project for my [AnkerMake M5](https://www.ankermake.com/eu-en/m5?ref=naviMenu_2_2_img) is to take a closer look at [Gridfinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra_9zU-mnl8). It seems to me to be a [nice system](https://gridfinity.xyz). Now I just need to figure out which base plates I can best use.\n\n- 💻 This week I wanted to use a VPN connection with a device that is only WLAN capable. Since there is no way to set up a VPN service directly on the device, I thought it should be easy to make my Mac's VPN connection available to other devices via WLAN Sharing. Well, far from it. Basically, it seems to be possible somehow, but unfortunately not with the help of [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/), my until now used VPN provider 😢.\n\n- 👌 In the Apple universe, of course, the launch of the [Apple Vision Pro](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/) was the event of the week. The usual suspects have already [written](https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/the_vision_pro) or [published videos](https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price) extensively about it. As a European, I will thankfully not be confronted with the question of whether it might be worth the money for me in the next couple months. Basically, I am of course extremely fascinated and would give a lot to be able to try it out. Especially the entertainment aspect appeals to me, because my better half only tolerates a tiny 32\" TV in the living room, [^4] and not only having a home cinema, but a whole iMAX cinema in my own four walls, of course appears extremely tempting. However, I am also not sure what would happen if I used a VisionPro at home in her presence, I at least only dared to use the PS VR 1 when she was out ... 🤷‍♂️\n\n- 📝 Last but not least, [Obsidian](https://mas.to/@obsidian/111863007663904581) now also offers servers outside the USA. I therefore moved my private Obsidian vault to a European server and immediately imagine that the synchronization is faster.

He is the author of [Micro.publish](https://github.com/otaviocc/obsidian-microblog), an Obsidian plugin that lets you publish directly to [micro.blog](https://micro.blog). Love it. I ran across a bug trying to publish my last weeknote and he was so kind to fix right it away 🤩. (Otávio even wrote a [blog post](https://otavio.cc/2024/01/01/micropublish.html) about it.)\n\n- 🇩🇪 [Marcus](https://digitalcourage.social/@mjaschen/111685272251532868) posted a link to [All German words (German wordlist)](https://gist.github.com/MarvinJWendt/2f4f4154b8ae218600eb091a5706b5f4) - who knows what it might be useful for in the future; bookmarked.\n\n- 🎮 Remakes I knew about, but I only just learned that there are also Demakes: [Demake of Portal for the Nintendo 64](https://github.com/lambertjamesd/portal64)\n\n- 🕹️ Downloaded [Crunchyroll Presents: Hime's Quest](https://crunchyroll.com/himesquest/) for my Analogue Pocket - *Go back to 1999 and help Crunchyroll-Hime protect New Crunchy City from Y2K!* By the way, my Analogue Pocket Dock has arrived, which I should have ordered directly. 🥰\n\n- 🎮 I don't even want to know how much time this boy has spent playing Tetris on the NES to achieve this: [13-Year-Old Becomes First to Beat NES Tetris](https://kottke.org/24/01/13-year-old-becomes-first-to-beat-nes-tetris). I also wonder why a 13-year-old spends his free time in front of an NES and not playing Fortnite or Minecraft 🤣. And how crazy are these different [playing techniques](https://kottke.org/21/05/new-nes-tetris-technique)?\n\n- 🐭 I thought this would never happen: [Welcome to the public domain, Mickey Mouse](https://www.theverge.com/24006670/mickey-mouse-steamboat-willie-enters-copyright-public-domain-2024) - *Steamboat Willie finally slips out of copyright*.[^1] As a result, you can now watch [Steamboat Willie](https://ledbetter-games.itch.io/steamboat-willie) via [Playorama](https://hteumeuleu.itch.io/playorama) on your [Playdate](https://play.date), if you want to.\n\n- 🤔 While [reviewing my subscriptions](https://mb.esamecar.net/2023/12/13/state-of-app.html), I had already considered canceling [kagi](https://kagi.com). [This](https://nileane.fr/@nileane/111705532073853768) made it easier for me, although I am aware that probably every search engine at least tolerates unethical practices indirectly or even practices them directly to some extent. My hope is that if service providers realize that such non-technical aspects are also relevant to customers, they will hopefully take them more into account in future decisions.\n\n- 📺 Finished Season 2 of [The Bear](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/136315) and [Loki](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/84958) - loved both.\n\n- 🤯 Watched [Oppenheimer](https://trakt.tv/movies/oppenheimer-2023) (2023) - and I wanted to be more [optimistic](https://mastodon.social/@kepano/111670149481580297) in 2024!\n\n[^1]: with many restrictions, of course\n",

id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup></p>\n<ul>\n<li>🟢 <a href=\"http://1password.com\">1Password</a>: <a href=\"https://mb.esamecar.net/2023/12/13/what-caught-my.html\">Until last week</a>, my standard password manager. I am currently considering whether it could potentially be replaced by Apple&rsquo;s Keychain; however, I am not fully there yet.</li>\n<li>🟢 <a href=\"http://anybox.app\">Anybox</a>: My current bookmark manager of choice; I could possibly live with the free version of <a href=\"https://raindrop.io\">Raindrop.io</a>; but even though the developer probably <a href=\"https://nitter.net/raindrop_io/status/1550785806796742656\">no longer lives</a> in Russia, the <a href=\"https://numericcitizen.me/when-war-in-ukraine-influences-my-application-choices/\">proximity</a> is somehow still too uncomfortable for me.</li>\n<li>🟢 <a href=\"https://www.arqbackup.com\">Arq</a>: I use Arq since 2016 together with the countless TB of free OneDrive storage space available to me as part of the MS Office subscription; I couldn&rsquo;t sleep peacefully without offsite backup.</li>\n<li>🟢 <a href=\"https://chroniclingapp.com\">Chronicling</a>: I use it a lot lately, especially to fill my Daily Journal in Obsidian via Shortcuts.app; I really don&rsquo;t want to miss it.</li>\n<li>🟡 <a href=\"https://dayoneapp.com\">DayOne</a>: Since I moved my Daily Journal to Obsidian in the middle of the year, I don&rsquo;t really use it anymore. But I still let it be filled (automatically). My first entries go back to the year 2008, although I can&rsquo;t figure out when it was actually published. Would feel strange without it.</li>\n<li>🟢 <a href=\"https://getdrafts.com\">Drafts</a>: I used the app extensively in the past, then didn&rsquo;t understand it for a long time, and currently, I can&rsquo;t imagine life without it again.</li>\n<li>🟢 <a href=\"https://www.epicrideweather.com\">Epic Weather Ride</a>: An indispensable weather tool for planning bike tours.</li>\n<li>🔴 <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/fddb-kalorienz%C3%A4hler-di%C3%A4t/id1105332761\">FDDB</a>: I regularly fail to track my calories consistently and thus control my weight. Most of the year an unused app because it is too exhausting to constantly weigh your food. I should cancel and only resubscribe when I really (for a month or two) want to use it.</li>\n<li>🟢 <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/healthfit/id1202650514\">HealthFit</a>: One of the few ways to get .fit files from the <a href=\"https://www.hammerhead.io\">Hammerhead Karoo 2</a> into Apple Health and much more. Subscription is even voluntary and IMHO extremely well invested.</li>\n<li>🟡 <a href=\"http://iconnecthue.com\">iConnectHue</a>: An alternative way to program and control Philips Hue lamps. In the past, the things I wanted to implement could only be set up properly through it. However, I should take a look during the brighter time of the year to see if most of it can now also be done via the native app.</li>\n<li>🟡 <a href=\"http://ifttt.com\">ifttt</a>: Oh, I actually only use it to import various things into Day One automatically. I don&rsquo;t really need it but I love automating things 🤔.</li>\n<li>🟢 <a href=\"https://tapbots.com/ivory/\">Ivory</a>: There are a number of alternative Mastodon clients like <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mona-for-mastodon/id1659154653\">Mona</a> etc. that do not rely on a subscription; also, the development speed is not very high at the moment. On the other hand, I&rsquo;ve gotten very used to these very polished apps for iOS and macOS.</li>\n<li>🟡 <a href=\"http://kagi.com\">Kagi</a>: A really good Google alternative. But ultimately &ldquo;only&rdquo; for the conscience. It&rsquo;s not that I achieve anything with Kagi that wouldn&rsquo;t be possible with google.com or <a href=\"http://duckduckgo.com\">duckduckgo</a>.</li>\n<li>🔴 <a href=\"https://upaheadapp.com\">Up Ahead</a>: Incredible nice-looking app, but I feel like it hasn&rsquo;t been updated for almost a year now. (How nice it would be if you could simply add  entries from the calendar.) It&rsquo;s hard, but</li>\n<li>🟢 <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/mastodon\">Mastodon</a>: Completely voluntary and actually too small an amount.</li>\n<li>🔴 <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mercury-weather/id1621800675\">Mercury Weather</a>: I really like it, it has even won big at the <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2023-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/\">MacStories Selects</a>, but since I rarely travel to other places/countries and the Weather app is also getting better&hellip;</li>\n<li>🟢 <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">Micro.blog</a> : What can I say &hellip;</li>\n<li>🔴 <a href=\"https://www.mindnode.com\">Mindnode</a>: Used to be one of my most used apps; it is now also available via Setapp and I only have the subscription because of the iOS version; however, I use the latter very rarely ATM.</li>\n<li>🟡 MS Office 365: In the meantime, my sons through school as well as my wife and I through work theoretically have free access to Office at home, however, I paid for several years in advance a long time ago and now the subscription just runs. I use the storage space intensively with Arq (see above); I should check at some point whether it can be realized more cheaply.</li>\n<li>🟢 <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/neptunes/id1006739057?mt=12\">Neptunes</a>: Costs almost nothing and I use it daily on the Mac.</li>\n<li>🟢 <a href=\"https://nordvpn.com/\">NordVPN</a>: Everyone should have a VPN service, right?</li>\n<li>🟢 <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/sync\">Obsidian Sync</a>: Without Obsidian, my computer life would be meaningless right now. There would be alternatives to synchronize the content between platforms, but the Sync subscription is a good way to support Obsidian in its entirety.</li>\n<li>🔴 <a href=\"https://overcast.fm\">Overcast Premium</a>: I never understood the UI concept of Overcast. However, it has Shortcuts support and I have automated a few things with it. Are they really necessary? No.</li>\n<li>🔴 <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/personal-best-workouts/id1510256676\">Personal Best</a>: Nice, but the UI is still a bit too confusing for me and the actual benefit may be too small.</li>\n<li>🟡 <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/play-save-videos-watch-later/id1596506190\">Play</a>: I&rsquo;ll take a look at it again in a year. Right now, I really enjoy the channels feature <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/play-2-0-adds-youtube-channel-support-folders-and-a-new-premium-subscription/\">introduced in 2.0</a>.</li>\n<li>🔴 <a href=\"https://www.pixelmator.com/photomator/\">Photomator</a>: Great app, but I don&rsquo;t use it often enough.</li>\n<li>🟡 <a href=\"https://readwise.io/read\">Reader Readwise</a>: The price is at the upper limit of pain for me but only thanks to an educational discount. I use the app very extensively; if it were more expensive, I would switch to <a href=\"http://omnivore.app\">Omnivore</a>.</li>\n<li>🟢 <a href=\"https://setapp.com/de\">Setapp</a>: Worth the money thanks to the Edu discount.</li>\n<li>🔴 <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/s%C3%B6ka-bucket-lists-made-easy/id6446223795\">Söka</a>: I like it. I travel too little to really take advantage of it. Maybe I&rsquo;ll subscribe for a month or so before the next vacation?</li>\n<li>🟡 <a href=\"https://timeryapp.com\">Timery</a>: I use it professionally, but I pay for it privately because it helps me keep a little better track.</li>\n<li>🟡 <a href=\"https://trakt.tv/vip\">trakt.tv</a>: Actually, I watch too few series to justify a VIP account.

				"content_text": "\nI use a variety of different apps and services on iOS and macOS. Most of them are based on subscription models, and even though I try to make sure that each program doesn't cost more than 5 € / month, a not insignificant monthly amount[^1] quickly adds up.\n\nHere is a table of all the apps and services I'm currently subscribed to:[^2]\n\n| App or Service | Cost / Month | Type | State |\n| ---- | ---: | :--: | :--: |\n| 1Password | 5.50 € | y | 🟢 |\n| Anybox | 1.21 € | y | 🟢 |\n| Arq | 3.22 € | y | 🟢 |\n| Chronicling | 0.83 € | y | 🟢 |\n| DayOne | 2.21 € | y | 🟢 |\n| Drafts | 1.71 € | y | 🟢 |\n| Epic Weather Ride | 0.71 € | y | 🟢 |\n| FDDB | 2.00 € | 1/2y | 🔴 |\n| HealthFit | 0.50 € | y | 🟢 |\n| iConnectHue | 1.67 € | y | 🟡 |\n| ifttt | 1.39 € | y | 🟡 |\n| Ivory | 2.50 € | y | 🟢 |\n| Kagi | 4.63 € | m | 🟡 |\n| Mastodon | 1.79 € | m | 🟢 |\n| Mercury Weather | 1.67 € | y | 🔴 |\n| Micro.blog | 4.63 € | m | 🟢 |\n| Mindnode | 1.83 € | y | 🔴 |\n| MS Office 365 | 8.25 € | y | 🟡 |\n| Neptunes | 0.17 € | y | 🟢 |\n| NordVPN | 3.80 € | y | 🟢 |\n| Obsidian Sync | 4.45 € | y | 🟢 |\n| Overcast Premium | 0.83 € | y | 🔴 |\n| Personal Best | 0.50 € | y | 🔴 |\n| Play | 1.92 € | y | 🟡 |\n| Photomator | 2.92 € | y | 🔴 |\n| Readwise | 3.71 € | y | 🟡 |\n| Setapp | 5.50 € | y | 🟢 |\n| Söka | 0.83 € | y | 🔴 |\n| Timery | 0.87 € | y | 🟡 |\n| trakt.tv | 2.32 € | y | 🟡 |\n| Training Today | 1.50 € | y | 🔴 |\n| TV Forecast | 0.83 € | y | 🟢 |\n| Up Ahead | 1.00 € | y | 🔴 |\n| Waterllama | 0.58 € |  |  |\n| YNAB | 8.19 € | y | 🟢 |\n| Zenitizer | 1.83 € | y | 🟡 |\n| Apple One Premium | 31.95 € | m | 🟢 |\n| Disney+ | 7.50 € | y | 🟢 |\n| Nintendo Switch Online | 2.92 € | y | 🟡 |\n| PlayStationPlus | 5.00 € | y | 🟡 |\n| Wahoo Systm | 13.75 € | m | 🟢 |\n| **Total**: | 141.64 € |  |  |\n\nIn total, they cost well over 140 € a month, which is 1700 €[^3] a year! 😱\n\nTime to go through all the apps one by one and consider whether I really need them and whether they are still worth their money to me.[^4]\n\n- 🟢 [1Password](http://1password.com): [Until last week](https://mb.esamecar.net/2023/12/13/what-caught-my.html), my standard password manager. I am currently considering whether it could potentially be replaced by Apple's Keychain; however, I am not fully there yet.\n- 🟢 [Anybox](http://anybox.app): My current bookmark manager of choice; I could possibly live with the free version of [Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io); but even though the developer probably [no longer lives](https://nitter.net/raindrop_io/status/1550785806796742656) in Russia, the [proximity](https://numericcitizen.me/when-war-in-ukraine-influences-my-application-choices/) is somehow still too uncomfortable for me. \n- 🟢 [Arq](https://www.arqbackup.com): I use Arq since 2016 together with the countless TB of free OneDrive storage space available to me as part of the MS Office subscription; I couldn't sleep peacefully without offsite backup. \n- 🟢 [Chronicling](https://chroniclingapp.com): I use it a lot lately, especially to fill my Daily Journal in Obsidian via Shortcuts.app; I really don't want to miss it. \n- 🟡 [DayOne](https://dayoneapp.com): Since I moved my Daily Journal to Obsidian in the middle of the year, I don't really use it anymore. But I still let it be filled (automatically). My first entries go back to the year 2008, although I can't figure out when it was actually published. Would feel strange without it.\n- 🟢 [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com): I used the app extensively in the past, then didn't understand it for a long time, and currently, I can't imagine life without it again. \n- 🟢 [Epic Weather Ride](https://www.epicrideweather.com): An indispensable weather tool for planning bike tours. \n- 🔴 [FDDB](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/fddb-kalorienz%C3%A4hler-di%C3%A4t/id1105332761): I regularly fail to track my calories consistently and thus control my weight. Most of the year an unused app because it is too exhausting to constantly weigh your food. I should cancel and only resubscribe when I really (for a month or two) want to use it.\n- 🟢 [HealthFit](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/healthfit/id1202650514): One of the few ways to get .fit files from the [Hammerhead Karoo 2](https://www.hammerhead.io) into Apple Health and much more. Subscription is even voluntary and IMHO extremely well invested. \n- 🟡 [iConnectHue](http://iconnecthue.com): An alternative way to program and control Philips Hue lamps. In the past, the things I wanted to implement could only be set up properly through it. However, I should take a look during the brighter time of the year to see if most of it can now also be done via the native app. \n- 🟡 [ifttt](http://ifttt.com): Oh, I actually only use it to import various things into Day One automatically. I don't really need it but I love automating things 🤔. \n- 🟢 [Ivory](https://tapbots.com/ivory/): There are a number of alternative Mastodon clients like [Mona](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mona-for-mastodon/id1659154653) etc. that do not rely on a subscription; also, the development speed is not very high at the moment. On the other hand, I've gotten very used to these very polished apps for iOS and macOS. \n- 🟡 [Kagi](http://kagi.com): A really good Google alternative. But ultimately \"only\" for the conscience. It's not that I achieve anything with Kagi that wouldn't be possible with google.com or [duckduckgo](http://duckduckgo.com). \n- 🔴 [Up Ahead](https://upaheadapp.com): Incredible nice-looking app, but I feel like it hasn't been updated for almost a year now. (How nice it would be if you could simply add  entries from the calendar.) It's hard, but \n- 🟢 [Mastodon](https://www.patreon.com/mastodon): Completely voluntary and actually too small an amount. \n- 🔴 [Mercury Weather](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mercury-weather/id1621800675): I really like it, it has even won big at the [MacStories Selects](https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2023-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/), but since I rarely travel to other places/countries and the Weather app is also getting better... \n- 🟢 [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) : What can I say ...\n- 🔴 [Mindnode](https://www.mindnode.com): Used to be one of my most used apps; it is now also available via Setapp and I only have the subscription because of the iOS version; however, I use the latter very rarely ATM. \n- 🟡 MS Office 365: In the meantime, my sons through school as well as my wife and I through work theoretically have free access to Office at home, however, I paid for several years in advance a long time ago and now the subscription just runs. I use the storage space intensively with Arq (see above); I should check at some point whether it can be realized more cheaply. \n- 🟢 [Neptunes](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/neptunes/id1006739057?mt=12): Costs almost nothing and I use it daily on the Mac. \n- 🟢 [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/): Everyone should have a VPN service, right? \n- 🟢 [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync): Without Obsidian, my computer life would be meaningless right now. There would be alternatives to synchronize the content between platforms, but the Sync subscription is a good way to support Obsidian in its entirety. \n- 🔴 [Overcast Premium](https://overcast.fm): I never understood the UI concept of Overcast. However, it has Shortcuts support and I have automated a few things with it. Are they really necessary? No. \n- 🔴 [Personal Best](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/personal-best-workouts/id1510256676): Nice, but the UI is still a bit too confusing for me and the actual benefit may be too small. \n- 🟡 [Play](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/play-save-videos-watch-later/id1596506190): I'll take a look at it again in a year. Right now, I really enjoy the channels feature [introduced in 2.0](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/play-2-0-adds-youtube-channel-support-folders-and-a-new-premium-subscription/). \n- 🔴 [Photomator](https://www.pixelmator.com/photomator/): Great app, but I don't use it often enough. \n- 🟡 [Reader Readwise](https://readwise.io/read): The price is at the upper limit of pain for me but only thanks to an educational discount. I use the app very extensively; if it were more expensive, I would switch to [Omnivore](http://omnivore.app). \n- 🟢 [Setapp](https://setapp.com/de): Worth the money thanks to the Edu discount. \n- 🔴 [Söka](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/söka-bucket-lists-made-easy/id6446223795): I like it. I travel too little to really take advantage of it. Maybe I'll subscribe for a month or so before the next vacation? \n- 🟡 [Timery](https://timeryapp.com): I use it professionally, but I pay for it privately because it helps me keep a little better track. \n- 🟡 [trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv/vip): Actually, I watch too few series to justify a VIP account. But in this way, things can be automated very nicely and transferred to Day One via IFTT, etc. Oh ... \n- 🔴 [Training Today](https://trainingtodayapp.com): After the app once attested to me the best fitness despite fever and malaise, I believe it is just an (expensive) random number generator. \n- 🟢 [TV Forecast](https://tvforecastapp.com): I love this app. \n- [Waterllama](https://waterllama.com): I have now bought a Live Time license.\n- 🟢 [YNAB](https://www.ynab.com): Without YNAB, we would be heavily in debt, I would have even more pointless stuff, and my wife would have left me with the kids and dog. \n- 🟡 [Zenitizer](https://manuelkehl.com/apps/zenitizer/): The subscription reminds me that I damn well need to work on overcoming my inner laziness more regularly. \n- 🟢 Apple One Premium: As a family, we need a large iCloud storage tier just for the photos. In addition, we use Apple Music and Apple TV+. In total, still more expensive than Premium. It's a pity, really. \n- 🟢 Disney+: Marvel, Star Wars, etc. - we can't do without it. \n- 🟡 [Nintendo Switch Online](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Nintendo-Switch-Online/Benefits/Benefits-2060569.html): Necessary just for my son's ZELDA backup, although 😈 ... \n- 🟡 [PlayStationPlus](https://www.playstation.com/ps-plus/): If I could understand what exactly happens to my 300 previously \"acquired\" games through it if I were to cancel it, it might even be conceivable to do so 🤷‍♂️. \n- 🟢 [wahoo X](https://uk.wahoofitness.com/wahoo-x-membership): The Zwift UI has too negative an impact on my blood pressure; I have therefore been looking for a long time for an alternative to indoor cycling that just works reliably. The Sufferfest / wahoo SYSTM does this. My way of exercising in the winter months. \n\nWell, there are a few programs / services that I have now canceled as a result. I still have to think about the other 🟡 apps. It would probably be wise to cancel them as well and after the subscription expires, see if I can bear their loss and if not, just resubscribe.\n\nBut basically, nice things cost money and all these services and apps make my day easier or enrich my life. At least now I know where I stand at the moment. 😀\n\nP.S. I totally forgot to include [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol), my [e-mail provider](https://posteo.de/en), and Hemispheric Views' One Prime Plus, but those are all no-brainers for me. 😅\n\nP.P.S: This list only covers tech related stuff.

Therefore, my weeknote is regrettably appearing a little too late &ldquo;this week.&rdquo;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🔫 You may not necessarily like the content, but technically, the <a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=QdBZY2fkU-0\">trailer for GTA VI</a> definitely blew me away.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>✏️ Another PDF editor that I will look at in my long search for an alternative to Preview<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> is <a href=\"https://www.pdfgear.com\">PDFgear</a> - <em>PDF Tasks Made Easy.</em><sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🪟 <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/05/an-applescript-for-safari-split-tabs-to-new-window\">Gruber released</a> <em>An AppleScript for Safari to move all tabs in the frontmost window, from the current tab to the rightmost (last) tab, to a new window</em>: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/gruber/eb89728474ba59287df79c054e1097a5\">Split Tabs to New Window.scpt</a>.

Another nice app that does something similar is by <a href=\"https://fosstodon.org/@chrishannah\">Chris Hannah</a> and now apparently even free for iOS and macOS: <a href=\"https://textcase.app\">Text Case</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>📝 While I&rsquo;m on the topic of text editors. <a href=\"https://coteditor.com\">CotEditor</a> now also has a Quick Action Bar - if only the programs could agree on a uniform shortcut!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🕹 For the 30th anniversary of Doom, I <a href=\"https://www.gog.com/de/game/doom_1993\">bought it again</a> and immediately installed it <a href=\"https://www.paulfioravanti.com/blog/classic-doom-mac/\">on my MacBook</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/OnionUI/Ports-Collection\">Miyoo mini plus</a>. In keeping with this, John Romero released <a href=\"https://romero.com/sigil\">SIGIL II</a>. Speaking of Miyoo mini plus - there is now a <a href=\"https://github.com/XK9274/pico-8-wrapper-miyoo\">native pico-8 wrapper</a>, too 🥳.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>👾 I started playing <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0301905/\">Super Mario Advance</a> (GBA) on my Analogue Pocket. I noticed that I definitely never played Super Mario Bros. 2 before. (I could have sworn that I had at least tried all the major releases.) You can tell that the second part is a reskin and somehow it doesn&rsquo;t really fit into the series. I also find it absurdly difficult already in the third / fourth world. Let&rsquo;s see how far I will get in the game.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🎮 I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a coincidence or due to the recently released firmware updates, but lately my Playstation Portal has been running absolutely smoothly 🥰</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🧵 Unfortunately, I now have to crawl out of <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@gruber/110667962169426329\">my European library</a> again, because soon <a href=\"https://www.threads.net\">the fun begins here too</a>! (However, I will continue to ignore Threads, just like Facebook and Instagram, for the time being.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>↔️ In terms of features, it&rsquo;s not yet an alternative to Kaleidoscope, but it&rsquo;s affordable: <a href=\"https://proxymanstore.gumroad.com/l/textdiffer\">Text Differ</a> - <em>Meet Text Differ, a native macOS app that shows beautiful differences between 2 texts.</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🎙 Lately, I was a little annoyed by the ever-same content in my overflowing podcast subscription list. I think I will actually export all my subscribed podcasts, delete Overcast, and in Apple Podcasts, subscribe to <a href=\"https://ruminatepodcast.com\">Ruminate</a> and <a href=\"https://hemisphericviews.com\">Hemispheric Views</a>, and then consider whether and which <a href=\"https://flamedfury.com/posts/my-podcast-rotation-keeping-it-at-four/\">other two</a> of the usual suspects I choose. Also, I <a href=\"https://rknight.me/smart-speed-broke-my-brain/\">followed Robb&rsquo;s advice</a> and turned off Smart Speed and reset the playback speed to 1.0.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🛑 I have now forbidden 1Password on all my devices from wanting to fill anything anywhere and only use it as a (backup) vault.

				"content_text": "\nIn continuation of week [48](https://mb.esamecar.net/2023/12/03/what-caught-my.html), here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in week 49, 2023:\n\n- 🦠 Yes, I had already feared it, and unfortunately, it happened: My wife's Covid-19 infection did not pass me by. Therefore, my weeknote is regrettably appearing a little too late \"this week.\"\n\n- 🔫 You may not necessarily like the content, but technically, the [trailer for GTA VI](https://youtube.com/watch?v=QdBZY2fkU-0) definitely blew me away.\n\n- ✏️ Another PDF editor that I will look at in my long search for an alternative to Preview[^1] is [PDFgear](https://www.pdfgear.com) - *PDF Tasks Made Easy.*[^2]\n\n- 🪟 [Gruber released](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/05/an-applescript-for-safari-split-tabs-to-new-window) *An AppleScript for Safari to move all tabs in the frontmost window, from the current tab to the rightmost (last) tab, to a new window*: [Split Tabs to New Window.scpt](https://gist.github.com/gruber/eb89728474ba59287df79c054e1097a5). But even better is [the tip](https://mastodon.social/@jackwellborn/111539651190313429) from [Jack Wellborn](https://mastodon.social/@jackwellborn), that you can easily drag and drop multiple tabs into a new window.\n\n- 📝 I have been doing most of my (transformative) text work with BBEdit for decades. I really wouldn’t know what to do with my life without Multi-File Search and Regex, but sometimes I also like to use [TextBuddy](https://retina.studio/textbuddy/) or [Text Workflow](https://www.gtrigonakis.com/textworkflow). Another nice app that does something similar is by [Chris Hannah](https://fosstodon.org/@chrishannah) and now apparently even free for iOS and macOS: [Text Case](https://textcase.app).\n\n- 📝 While I'm on the topic of text editors. [CotEditor](https://coteditor.com) now also has a Quick Action Bar - if only the programs could agree on a uniform shortcut!\n\n- 🕹 For the 30th anniversary of Doom, I [bought it again](https://www.gog.com/de/game/doom_1993) and immediately installed it [on my MacBook](https://www.paulfioravanti.com/blog/classic-doom-mac/) and [Miyoo mini plus](https://github.com/OnionUI/Ports-Collection). In keeping with this, John Romero released [SIGIL II](https://romero.com/sigil). Speaking of Miyoo mini plus - there is now a [native pico-8 wrapper](https://github.com/XK9274/pico-8-wrapper-miyoo), too 🥳.\n\n- 👾 I started playing [Super Mario Advance](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0301905/) (GBA) on my Analogue Pocket. I noticed that I definitely never played Super Mario Bros. 2 before. (I could have sworn that I had at least tried all the major releases.) You can tell that the second part is a reskin and somehow it doesn't really fit into the series. I also find it absurdly difficult already in the third / fourth world. Let's see how far I will get in the game.\n\n- 🎮 I don't know if it's a coincidence or due to the recently released firmware updates, but lately my Playstation Portal has been running absolutely smoothly 🥰\n\n- 🧵 Unfortunately, I now have to crawl out of [my European library](https://mastodon.social/@gruber/110667962169426329) again, because soon [the fun begins here too](https://www.threads.net)! (However, I will continue to ignore Threads, just like Facebook and Instagram, for the time being.)\n\n- ↔️ In terms of features, it's not yet an alternative to Kaleidoscope, but it's affordable: [Text Differ](https://proxymanstore.gumroad.com/l/textdiffer) - *Meet Text Differ, a native macOS app that shows beautiful differences between 2 texts.*\n\n- 🎙 Lately, I was a little annoyed by the ever-same content in my overflowing podcast subscription list. I think I will actually export all my subscribed podcasts, delete Overcast, and in Apple Podcasts, subscribe to [Ruminate](https://ruminatepodcast.com) and [Hemispheric Views](https://hemisphericviews.com), and then consider whether and which [other two](https://flamedfury.com/posts/my-podcast-rotation-keeping-it-at-four/) of the usual suspects I choose. Also, I [followed Robb's advice](https://rknight.me/smart-speed-broke-my-brain/) and turned off Smart Speed and reset the playback speed to 1.0.\n\n- 🛑 I have now forbidden 1Password on all my devices from wanting to fill anything anywhere and only use it as a (backup) vault. I have exported all my passwords from 1PW into the Apple Keychain[^4], and my life has become significantly less annoying. I'm going to look at this for a few weeks now and then consider whether I completely get rid of 1PW or keep it running alongside.\n\n- 🖊️ iOS 17.2 was released, and with it the Journal.app. I can't do anything with the app itself, but [DayOne is allowed to use the same API](https://dayoneapp.com/blog/introducing-journaling-suggestions/) and can suggest the same things. That's cool![^3]\n\n- ⌚ watchOS 10.2 has brought back the ability to change Watch Faces by simple swiping. Thank you, Apple! I had to search for quite a while until I finally understood that this setting can only be made on the watch itself: `Settings > Clock > Swipe to Switch Watch Face`\n\n[^1]: In the past, I have suffered significant data loss after annotating PDFs with Preview.app, and since then, I no longer trust the application. Thank you, Apple.\n[^2]: However, I have not yet really understood their monetization concept.\n[^3]: At the moment, I primarily keep my Daily Journal in Obsidian but transfer a copy of it to Day One via Shortcuts.app; I need to rethink my use of Day One separately.\n[^4]: Of course, Safari crashed immediately during import; whoever is responsible for software quality at Apple, in my opinion, should be fired.\n",

I'd rather not touch anything and just let it continue as it is. And what is this RCS? Does it also run on mobile data or does the provider charge a fee for each message, like for an SMS? And if so, why does anyone believe that it could somehow be an alternative to WhatsApp? And these passkeys; is there really no way to copy them from Keychain to 1Password or vice versa? Do I have to think in advance about how and where to save them? Seriously? Then I'd rather stick with conventional passwords. Oh man 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️\n",

It was my first computer game in years, and probably the first AAA title in decades that I actually watched the end credits for. Usually, I start playing and then eventually stop. (Why should it be any different with video games than with other areas of my life?) I invested over 100 hours into Forbidden West, and whether or not that was a waste of time is for each person to decide, but I had a lot of fun. Over the past two weeks, I used the <a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/playstation-portal-remote-player/\">Playstation Portal</a>. This accessory for the PS5 is essentially just a (pretty good, but unfortunately not OLED) screen with a built-in, very good controller - nothing more and nothing less. It allows me to play on the couch in the living room while my wife watches one of her shows. (My wife doesn&rsquo;t like me playing games on the TV in the living room when she&rsquo;s present.) <a href=\"https://birchtree.me/blog/playstation-portal-early-review/\">The Portal suffers</a> from the same weaknesses as Playstation&rsquo;s Remote Play itself: even with very good Wi-Fi coverage and the PS5 connected to the router with a cable (and <a href=\"https://heydingus.net/blog/2023/11/playstation-ethernet-connection\">properly configured</a>), there are regular artifacts, slow downs, and sometimes even stuttering. I really hope that Sony gives its Remote Play implementation a little bit more attention and love now that they sell a dedicated device for this feature. But ultimately, I&rsquo;m quite satisfied, and the hardware is really well-made.

I also really like <a href=\"https://github.com/JustEnoughLinuxOS/distribution/releases\">JELOS</a>. HOWEVER, the hardware quality and customer service of this device and this company are extremely poor. The device arrived defective, with a stuck shoulder button. I had to contact Powkiddy multiple times to get a response. They casually suggested that I could try opening it up. Opening up a device that is only a few days old, still under warranty, with a spatula and screwdriver is not exactly what I had in mind. I actually managed to open the case and free the button without causing major damage to the device. Shortly after, another shoulder button got stuck, and then the first one again. And if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, the card slot eject mechanism also broke. All within one week. I really don&rsquo;t feel like having to dismantle the device every two days just to play a game for a few minutes. Powkiddy mentioned that I could send the device back to China at my own expense and then get a refund - yeah, right.

Yesterday it suddenly stopped connecting to my MacBook Pro (M1). It was listed, but clicking on connect did nothing. I made macOS Ventura forget the device and tried to reconnect it, but to no avail. I shut down the keyboard and rebooted everything, still no luck. I held the power button on the keyboard (no cable to connect with) until it flashed, tried several new batteries, asked the internet and just could not find a solution. </p>\n<p>It turned out that I had to press and hold the power button on my keyboard until it went into pairing mode, and <strong>I had to hold it down throughout the entire setup process</strong>, even while entering the pairing code (it did not even show up with my other approaches, only spinning indicators resulting in dead ends). I am 100% certain that I have never performed such an acrobatic dance to connect a keyboard to a computer before. But maybe I'm going senile.</p>\n",

I took the opportunity to completely reinstall the system. Most of it is now up and running, but <a href=\"https://www.python.org\">Python 3</a> was still missing. Python is a programming language that even I understand to some extent, but the installation is an absolute mess. This time I first installed <a href=\"https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv\">pyenv</a> via <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">Homebrew</a> and then Python. Maybe then the handling of the different versions won't slip through my fingers quite so quickly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python_environment.png\" alt=\"xkcd comic Python Environment\" title=\"xkcd comic Python Environment\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>✅ From time to time, I try to replace certain apps with Apple's own and see if they are now so good that I can do without third-party apps. A few weeks ago, I tried this with task management. I've been a <a href=\"https://culturedcode.com/things/\">Things</a> user since day one, managing both my work and personal tasks. Later, it became too confusing and I wanted to separate work and private tasks. I then used <a href=\"https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus\">OmniFocus</a> for work and Things for my private life. Unfortunately, the Siri integration via the Apple Watch didn't work well, especially because Siri doesn't understand English terms, like \"Things\" on German-language systems. Therefore, Siri never understood to which app I want to add a task to. That's why I gave up on Things a few years ago and used Apple's Reminders app for my private tasks. Thanks to smart lists, tags etc. I thought that I could possibly also manage my professional tasks with Reminders. But two weeks later I realised that this is not yet an option for me. The filter options for the smart lists are too limited, because you can't, for example, include one list and exclude another.

In addition, I wanted to completely abstain from alcohol for a month. Both worked out well. I'm sticking to meatless dinners and I've also stopped drinking a delicious pale ale or something else during the week. I think that can't hurt in the end. Since this has worked so well, I have come up with two new things for February: no sweets, chocolate, cakes or similar foods with a lot of added sugar. And additionally, no coffee. I had real withdrawal symptoms for the first two or three days (headache, fatigue, slight aching limbs). It's so hard for me to do without a delicious coffee in the morning. But well, there are only a good two weeks left. I don't know yet what nonsense I'll come up with for next month.  🤦‍♂️</li>\n</ul>\n",

It was a rather intimate podcast. And both the developers of the <a href=\"https://darknoise.app\">Darknoise</a> app and <a href=\"https://sofahq.com\">Sofa</a> seem to be very nice people. After what they said about <strong>software subscriptions</strong>, I&rsquo;m afraid that sooner or later all apps will have to switch to the subscription model. I personally don&rsquo;t like that, but if there&rsquo;s no other way for indie developers, you probably have to think about what you&rsquo;re willing to spend per year and then keep an eye on your subscriptions, e.g. with <a href=\"https://bobbyapp.co\">Bobby</a>, and limit them accordingly.</li>\n<li>🛋️ Speaking of <a href=\"https://sofahq.com\">Sofa</a>. I really like the app, but I think I&rsquo;ll try to stay away from software and services where it&rsquo;s not possible to get your data out again with open standards, an API or at least an RSS feed.</li>\n<li>🫰 Speaking of subscriptions, after all this <a href=\"https://mas.to/@dcrainmaker/109761992004211636\">back and forth</a>, I <strong>cancelled my Strava subscription</strong>. I&rsquo;ll see if I can enjoy cycling without all their pro features.</li>\n<li>🚴‍♂️ Speaking of (I know, I know &hellip;) cycling, once again I have felt annoyed, no, <strong>threatened by SUV</strong> drivers. I really don&rsquo;t know where all this is going. Fittingly, the <a href=\"https://indieweb.social/@magalhini/109739198359436268\">post</a> about the size of cars.</li>\n<li>🐘 I had a look at <strong><a href=\"https://social.shadowfacts.net/objects/25db7fa3-31e5-46aa-a534-643de7617f8e\">Tusker</a></strong>, a new iOS Mastodon client. It&rsquo;s still fun to see all these many ideas for Mastodon clients. There hasn&rsquo;t been so much dynamism in the scene for a long time. Even though <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ice-cubes-for-mastodon/id6444915884\">IceCube</a> gets a lot of praise, I keep coming back to <a href=\"https://tapbots.com/ivory/\">Ivory</a>, which was finally released in the App Store this week. You can only have missed it, though, if you&rsquo;ve been living under a rock. Even though I find the development speed of IceCube absolutely remarkable and the app is certainly one of the most impressive in terms of features, I am still bothered by the many small bugs and especially the bad scrolling performance. (I think SwiftUI might be the one to blame here.) Ivory, on the other hand, is really fast and performant. The great thing is that you can change at any time.</li>\n<li>🕹️ I&rsquo;ve played the two new <strong>playdate games</strong> that were released for me this week: <a href=\"https://play.date/games/flipper-lifter/\">Flipper Lifter</a> and <a href=\"https://play.date/games/echoic-memory/\">Echoic Memory</a>. I am really bad at audio and don&rsquo;t know if I enjoy Echoic Memory and I haven&rsquo;t found any access to Flipper Lifter yet. In general, with some playdate games, I sometimes feel like I don&rsquo;t really understand the mechanics of the game, and just do anything that will somehow get me to the goal. I sometimes wish the games would introduce you a little more and not leave you completely out in the cold.</li>\n<li>🕹️ In the end, everything was overshadowed by the fact that my <strong>playdate</strong> probably <strong>has</strong> a <strong>faulty battery</strong>. I have, surprisingly unexpectedly, received an answer from <a href=\"https://social.panic.com/@cabel/109757052741921514\">Cabel</a>, but unfortunately not yet from support. They seem to be quite overwhelmed by support requests right now.</li>\n<li>📱 On <strong>iOS</strong>, I looked at <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1489443070\">Countdown to Anything!</a> but I think I&rsquo;ll stick with <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/countdowns-termine-verfolgen/id917514700\">Countdowns</a>.</li>\n<li>📱 This <a href=\"https://social.lol/@inkeduprunner/109744118273037005\">screenshot</a> of Jason&rsquo;s homescreen inspired me to tinker a little bit with <a href=\"https://social.lol/@inkeduprunner/109744118273037005\">Widgy</a>. I also bought <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/opener-open-links-in-apps/id989565871\">Opener</a>, don&rsquo;t know why 😇</li>\n<li>💻 On the <strong>Mac</strong>, I&rsquo;ve been looking at the new <a href=\"https://thebrowser.company\">Arc</a> browser, which is kind of hyped right now. I really don&rsquo;t know why though. I have a bit of a suspicion that it might just be the invite system. To me, the browser seems extremely sluggish. My password management and Apple Pay don&rsquo;t work, which is probably not the browser&rsquo;s fault. It&rsquo;s too early to judge, but so far I always go back to Safari after a short time.</li>\n<li>💻 It came to my mind, that you can use Markdown links of <a href=\"https://mastodon.cloud/@cogsciapps/109758770719895321\">hooked</a> items together with <a href=\"https://sindresorhus.com/one-thing\">One Thing</a>, an App that I really enjoy. It gives you one click menu bar item to the one file you are just working on.</li>\n<li>💻 I had a look at <a href=\"https://hidock.app/\">HiDock, for Mac</a> and <a href=\"https://thelasso.app/\">Lasso - Window Manager for macOS</a>.</li>\n<li>💻 Thanks to <a href=\"https://social.lol/@mken/109750124058233654\">Matthew</a> I became aware of <a href=\"https://menubarx.app\">Menubar X</a> (<a href=\"https://setapp.com/de/apps/menubarx\">Setapp</a>).

The only thing I miss so far is the ability to filter by focus modes, like it is possible with Calendars, etc. Only Apple knows why this is not possible yet, I guess.</li>\n<li>❤️ Thanks to <a href=\"https://social.lol/@faisal/109750741237166481\">Faisal Misle</a>, I now also know that you can publish to the omg.lol weblog via <a href=\"https://github.com/neatnik/weblog.lol\">github</a>. I have no idea about all these things, but thanks to the many great tutorials, even I managed to do it.

Hope that I get the curve then next week.\n\n- 🍿 Watched [Raymond & Ray (2022)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/869025) - ★★★★☆ and enjoyed it.\n- 🎙️ Listend to a bunch of different **Podcasts**: \n    - [Accidental Tech Podcast: 518: Deconstructed iMac](https://overcast.fm/+R7DVtneAw), \n    - [Core Intuition: Episode 545: Lawful Evil](https://overcast.fm/+Kuq_jKm0Y), \n    - [MeTacheles Tonspur: Return of the Mac - Ode an den Apple Macintosh](https://overcast.fm/+4TI7Zrdgw), \n    - [Playdate Podcast: Flipper Lifter](https://overcast.fm/+5DdoG0klE), \n    - [Playdate Podcast: Echoic Memory](https://overcast.fm/+5DdoqkQbQ), \n    - [Techmeme Ride Home: Tue 01/24 – ALL The Details On Apple’s Headset](https://overcast.fm/+TRbU9iufs), \n    - [AppStories: Imagining Apps for an Apple VR Headset](https://overcast.fm/+I5Cmvd2J8), \n    - [Launched: 54: Sofa - Shawn Hickman](https://overcast.fm/+WB397kIrk), \n    - [Upgrade: 443: Core Variations](https://overcast.fm/+Fcm-k7iqs), and \n    - [Hemispheric Views: 076: Find Jason a House!](https://overcast.fm/+hdKNj8kKg). \n - 🎙️ This was my **first episode of [Launched](https://mastodon.social/@Launched/109744688589490094)**. It was a rather intimate podcast. And both the developers of the [Darknoise](https://darknoise.app) app and [Sofa](https://sofahq.com) seem to be very nice people. After what they said about **software subscriptions**, I'm afraid that sooner or later all apps will have to switch to the subscription model. I personally don't like that, but if there's no other way for indie developers, you probably have to think about what you're willing to spend per year and then keep an eye on your subscriptions, e.g. with [Bobby](https://bobbyapp.co), and limit them accordingly.\n- 🛋️ Speaking of [Sofa](https://sofahq.com). I really like the app, but I think I'll try to stay away from software and services where it's not possible to get your data out again with open standards, an API or at least an RSS feed.\n- 🫰 Speaking of subscriptions, after all this [back and forth](https://mas.to/@dcrainmaker/109761992004211636), I **cancelled my Strava subscription**. I'll see if I can enjoy cycling without all their pro features.\n- 🚴‍♂️ Speaking of (I know, I know ...) cycling, once again I have felt annoyed, no, **threatened by SUV** drivers. I really don't know where all this is going. Fittingly, the [post](https://indieweb.social/@magalhini/109739198359436268) about the size of cars.\n- 🐘 I had a look at **[Tusker](https://social.shadowfacts.net/objects/25db7fa3-31e5-46aa-a534-643de7617f8e)**, a new iOS Mastodon client. It's still fun to see all these many ideas for Mastodon clients. There hasn't been so much dynamism in the scene for a long time. Even though [IceCube](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ice-cubes-for-mastodon/id6444915884) gets a lot of praise, I keep coming back to [Ivory](https://tapbots.com/ivory/), which was finally released in the App Store this week. You can only have missed it, though, if you've been living under a rock. Even though I find the development speed of IceCube absolutely remarkable and the app is certainly one of the most impressive in terms of features, I am still bothered by the many small bugs and especially the bad scrolling performance. (I think SwiftUI might be the one to blame here.) Ivory, on the other hand, is really fast and performant. The great thing is that you can change at any time.\n-  🕹️ I've played the two new **playdate games** that were released for me this week: [Flipper Lifter](https://play.date/games/flipper-lifter/) and [Echoic Memory](https://play.date/games/echoic-memory/). I am really bad at audio and don't know if I enjoy Echoic Memory and I haven't found any access to Flipper Lifter yet. In general, with some playdate games, I sometimes feel like I don't really understand the mechanics of the game, and just do anything that will somehow get me to the goal. I sometimes wish the games would introduce you a little more and not leave you completely out in the cold. \n- 🕹️ In the end, everything was overshadowed by the fact that my **playdate** probably **has** a **faulty battery**. I have, surprisingly unexpectedly, received an answer from [Cabel](https://social.panic.com/@cabel/109757052741921514), but unfortunately not yet from support. They seem to be quite overwhelmed by support requests right now.\n- 📱 On **iOS**, I looked at [Countdown to Anything!](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1489443070) but I think I'll stick with [Countdowns](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/countdowns-termine-verfolgen/id917514700). \n- 📱 This [screenshot](https://social.lol/@inkeduprunner/109744118273037005) of Jason's homescreen inspired me to tinker a little bit with [Widgy](https://social.lol/@inkeduprunner/109744118273037005). I also bought [Opener](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/opener-open-links-in-apps/id989565871), don't know why 😇\n- 💻 On the **Mac**, I've been looking at the new [Arc](https://thebrowser.company) browser, which is kind of hyped right now. I really don't know why though. I have a bit of a suspicion that it might just be the invite system. To me, the browser seems extremely sluggish. My password management and Apple Pay don't work, which is probably not the browser's fault. It's too early to judge, but so far I always go back to Safari after a short time. \n- 💻 It came to my mind, that you can use Markdown links of [hooked](https://mastodon.cloud/@cogsciapps/109758770719895321) items together with [One Thing](https://sindresorhus.com/one-thing), an App that I really enjoy. It gives you one click menu bar item to the one file you are just working on.\n- 💻 I had a look at [HiDock, for Mac](https://hidock.app/) and [Lasso - Window Manager for macOS](https://thelasso.app/).\n- 💻 Thanks to [Matthew](https://social.lol/@mken/109750124058233654) I became aware of [Menubar X](https://menubarx.app) ([Setapp](https://setapp.com/de/apps/menubarx)). This works pretty well together with [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) / [DeepL Write](https://www.deepl.com/write) and [elk.zone](https://elk.zone/).\n- ✅ I've moved all my todo item for work from [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) to Apple's Reminders app. I want to see if I can separate them enough thanks to smart lists and tags. The only thing I miss so far is the ability to filter by focus modes, like it is possible with Calendars, etc. Only Apple knows why this is not possible yet, I guess.\n- ❤️ Thanks to [Faisal Misle](https://social.lol/@faisal/109750741237166481), I now also know that you can publish to the omg.lol weblog via [github](https://github.com/neatnik/weblog.lol). I have no idea about all these things, but thanks to the many great tutorials, even I managed to do it. Speaking of [omg.lol](https://omg.lol) and how clueless I am about all this internet stuff, I managed to change my [status.log](https://esamecar.status.lol) via the [API](https://api.omg.lol/), again thanks to the awesome docs. I control this with a Shortcuts shortcut and can trigger it from my [Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/) and [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/).

A podcast I did not know about before. This was a very intimate conversation and I discovered so much of myself in what was told. Unfortunately, I can't even begin to speak with such reflection and eloquence. There's definitely a reason I'm not a podcaster, and an absolutely insignificant little fish otherwise. What I also found very interesting was <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+B7ND0zcCY\">The Talk Show: ‘Slow-Moving Hurricane’, With Craig Hockenberry</a>. I only knew Craig Hockenberry from <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@chockenberry\">his posts and profile picture</a>. I was very surprised to listen to such a level-headed, reflective person. It's always exciting what impressions you get about people just by reading about them or listening to them. The episode <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+6u81QBHHQ\">Really Specific Stories: Jason Burk</a> fit in very well with this. I'm already looking forward to the others.</li>\n<li>🎙️ Parallel to the release of the two new games <a href=\"https://play.date/games/lost-your-marbles/\">Lost Your Marbles</a> and <a href=\"https://play.date/games/pickpackpup/\">Pick Pack Pup</a> in Series 1 for <a href=\"https://esamecar.net/2023/01/07/playdate.html\">my playdate</a> I listened to the respective podcast episodes: <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+5Ddo1eC7M\">Playdate Podcast: Pick Pack Pup</a> and <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+5DdrMprw0\">Playdate Podcast: Lost Your Marbles</a>. </li>\n<li>🎙️ Additionally I've listened to <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+Fcm_P4vGY\">Upgrade: 441: Qi2: Qi Harder</a>, <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+I5CmMcSjU\">AppStories: Read-Later Apps</a>, <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+Fcm-buxIs\">Upgrade: 442: Zombie Arms and Toaster Fridge</a>, <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+FgnYjcuX0\">Under the Radar: 260: Subscription School</a> and <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+FXx6P7vZI\">Connected: 433: The Best Alarm is the Alarm</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For these posts, I was looking for a way to log the podcast episodes I was listening to, but couldn't find a way to look them up in <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/\">Overcast</a>. So I wrote a Shortcuts script that logs the currently playing episode to a Drafts document after 30 seconds.</li>\n<li>🥘 Speaking of the Shortcuts app. I love <a href=\"https://mela.recipes\">Mela</a> and in my family we use <a href=\"https://www.ponlist.de\">Pon</a> for shopping lists. Unfortunately, there is no way to export shopping lists directly from Mela to Pon. And it is not possible to import the corresponding Reminders list into Pon. So I put together a little <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/9c1fa9b21f574dfd81d65e8ae55e8305\">shortcut</a> that somehow does the job.</li>\n<li>❤️ I was playing around with my <a href=\"https://now.esamecar.net\">omg/now</a> page.</li>\n<li>💻 I bought <a href=\"https://www.houdah.com/photosWorkbench/\">Photos Workbench</a>. I think I will mainly use it to compare and select pictures. I really miss a corresponding function in the Photos app. I have looked a lot for alternatives and had even subscribed to Lightroom in the meantime. But that's a complete overkill and I don't want to have any more software from that company. That's why I'm happy that an app has now been released that will hopefully take care of that.</li>\n<li>🕹️ Played <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/pick-pack-pup/3030-82889/\">Pick Pack Pup (2022)</a> and the first ten levels of <a href=\"https://social.lol/@esamecar/109727415412705797\">Gravity Express</a>. The former is fine but I did not fell in love so far. The latter ist very similar to <a href=\"https://possiblyaxolotl.itch.io/rocketbytes\">Rocket Bytes</a> but Gravity Express has checkpoints, tasks, fuel, etc. I seems not that hardcore as the other.</li>\n<li>🗼Stumbled across <a href=\"https://lantern.rknight.me\">Lantern</a>. </li>\n<li>Bought <a href=\"https://mstdn.plus/@lapcatsoftware/109718227833446585\">Homecoming for Mastodon</a>.

Unlike many others, I'm not warming up to the app. It has too many little bugs that make it hard for me to use it regularly. But of course, the whole <a href=\"https://social.lol/@esamecar/109717531311835254\">App Store approval saga</a> was funny - or rather the opposite.</li>\n<li>🎙️<a href=\"https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper/large\">MacWhisper</a>: It's absolutely impressive what's now possible.</li>\n<li>💬 Too much <a href=\"https://social.lol/@esamecar\">Mastodon</a> but I really like it there.

Unfortunately, I can't even begin to speak with such reflection and eloquence. There's definitely a reason I'm not a podcaster, and an absolutely insignificant little fish otherwise. What I also found very interesting was [The Talk Show: ‘Slow-Moving Hurricane’, With Craig Hockenberry](https://overcast.fm/+B7ND0zcCY).

I'd rather not know how many emails I've missed because of this. 🤯 At least, I think, I've resolved the issue: Under <a href=\"http://icloud.com\">icloud.com</a> / Mail / Settings / Accounts I’ve disabled the Alias addresses, filled in Fullname and Label, renabled the Account alias and now it’s working again.\n\n\n## 2023-01-25\n### Apple Mail (macOS 13.1)\n\nOf course, it would be nice if Apple Mail would also show me my emails.\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/95406/2023/7fe26434ec.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Apple Mail not showing the selected mail.\" title=\"CleanShot 2023-01-25 at 09.31.34.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"596\" height=\"212\" />\n\n### Home Screen (iOS 16.2)\n\nAh, not only does the lock screen not want to show widgets all the time, the (Files.app) widget on the home screen can also be empty.\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/95406/2023/a81e9280f8.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot iOS home screen with blank Files.app widget\" title=\"IMG_8231.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"139\" height=\"300\" />\n\n### App Store (iOS 16.2)\n\nWhy not give us even more sorting options for subscriptions?

It told me that I don't have Xcode CLI tools installed and asked me to do so. I already had but, yeah, anyhow, I did it via the given shell command ... A few minutes later macOS tells me that there a two updates available. \n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/95406/2023/9df68b44a0.png\" alt=\"Screenshot Updates available - CLI Tools Xcode\" title=\"updates_cli_xcode.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"299\" height=\"69\" />\n\nWTF? Why two versions? And why an update anyways, I just downloaded them directly from Apple?\n\n### Shortcuts\nThe Apple Shortcuts App constantly gets out of sync between my MacBook and my iPhone. Thanks!\n\n\n### Reminders\nWhy does adding reminders via Siri work without any problems under iOS and exactly the same request via Siri under macOS leads to absolutely pointless queries and error messages (at least when set to GER)? WTF?\n",

I've installed [irssi](https://irssi.org/) via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), was able to connect, but failed with its operation. I'll have to look at it again some other time. Even though I am not a fan of, I understand very well why [Discord](https://discord.com) etc. have become famous 🤦‍♂️\n- 🍩 I've 3Dprinted some small things, primarily for household or work purposes, such as an [iPad Stand](https://www.printables.com/de/model/96617-ipad-stand), to use it as a second monitor at work and a [tea bag drainer](https://www.printables.com/de/model/295408-tea-bag-drainer-v2/files). And of course things for my AnkerMake M5 itself, like [Spare Parts Box](https://www.printables.com/de/model/304873-ankermake-m5-spare-parts-box/files) and [Accessory Bins](https://www.printables.com/model/345230-accessory-bins-for-ankermake-m5). (I was already afraid that this is another hobby that is only concerned with itself. In other words, you do things with it that you only do because you now have this thing that does things ... You understand me.)\n- 🤯 For me, I still haven't been able to conclusively determine on which platform I want to follow whom and where I want to post something and how. The interoperability of the fedivers (micro.blog <-> mastodon together with RSS etc.) is ingenious, but it also leads to a lot of friction and redundancy at least for me. I definitely need to get better at this. In all the experimenting I've been doing over the last few days, I've often had the problem of finding the exact URL of an RSS feed. To achive this via Reeder or similar was too cumbersome  for me and the times when the browser I use simply displayed the feeds prominently are also long gone. I have therefore created an iOS/macOS [shortcuts](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/fcaa7a4964ff4c078a6a13047a59fdfe). I'm not good at it, but it does the job I hope.\n- 👨‍💻 Oh, I almost forgot. The battery on my private Intel MacBook Pro was dead. I had it replaced. It cost me € 229 - not exactly cheap. But the whole thing, including sending it in (to the Czech Republic, repair and return) took less than three days 👏. However, I got a new top case with a new keyboard etc., which probably wasn't a bad idea for that model. Since it had already been in use for several years, I decided to completely rebuild it. I would have preferred to save myself the experience. So many little macOS (iCloud) bugs in the process really annoyed me and the new system settings are hell.\n\n🙋‍♂️\n",

Also available via [Setapp](https://setapp.com/).\n\n- [Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/): <em>\"Mind-blowing emoji on your Mac.\"</em> I really enjoy using this emoji picker. Tried using the one from Recast but went back to Rocket.\n\n- [Quitall](https://amicoapps.com/app/quitall/): <em>\"Before you Force Quit, QuitAll. A fresh start without a restart.\"</em> If it wasn't included in my [Setapp](https://setapp.com/) subscription I probably would not have bought it. I know it's a bad habit under macOS to quit apps but sometimes I have so many of them open, that I prefer a fresh start. That's were Quintal comes into play.\n\n- [Hookmark](https://hookproductivity.com): <em>\"Search Less. Focus more.\"</em> If you haven't heart of Hookmark yet, go and check it out. It's really awesome and I wish something like this was build directly into macOS. You can more or less interlink everything. Also available via [Setapp](https://setapp.com/).\n\n- And of course there are some productivity apps I mainly use for work <a href=\"https://kapeli.com/dash\">Dash</a>, <a href=\"https://www.devontechnologies.com/\">DevonThink</a>, <a href=\"https://stclairsoft.com/DefaultFolderX/\">Default Folder X</a>, <a href=\"https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/\">Keyboard Maestro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.noodlesoft.com/\">Hazel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.econtechnologies.com/chronosync/overview.html\">ChronoSync</a>. Maybe I'll write a little more about them later.\n\n- Oh, I would have forgotten about [CCC](https://bombich.com/de): <em>\"CCC does everything you wish Time Machine did (and more!)\"</em> Buy it, use it! (Or [SuperDuper!](https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html) I don't care 😎)\n\n<strong>Update</strong>: <a href=\"https://mb.esamecar.net/2023/01/14/even-more-macos.html\">even more apps ...</a>\n\n",

There, Mammoth also makes a very good impression, but in the end I was lucky and was able to test <a href=\"https://tapbots.social/@ivory\">Ivory</a> via Testflight.

The recently added <a href=\"https://social.lol/@esamecar/109653526172609597\">list features</a> are awesome, as they allow certain accounts to be hidden from the home view. So, atm I stick to Ivory and am looking forward to even better builds.</p>\n<p>Then, sometime last week, I came across a <a href=\"https://social.lol/@otaviocc/109607448264194924\">post</a> from <a href=\"https://social.lol/@otaviocc\">@otaviocc@social.lol</a> on <a href=\"https://home.omg.lol\">omg.lol</a>. And then, coincidentally, I signed up for the service with thousands of other people (<a href=\"https://omglol.news/2023/01/07/wildest-36-hours-ever\">who must have read a post on Hacker News</a> and not otaviocc&rsquo;s post 😎).\nOn omg.lol you ultimately get a &ldquo;funny&rdquo; address on the web that contains a wide variety of small services. A single page website (to use as a <a href=\"https://esamecar.omg.lol\">business card</a>), a <a href=\"http://esamecar.status.lol\">statuslog</a>, an omg.lol-email address (forwarder), different DNS services, pastebin, PURL service, a <a href=\"http://esamecar.weblog.lol\">weblog</a> (beta), etc. And while I was at it anyways, I also have my <a href=\"https://social.lol/@esamecar\">Mastodon</a> account moved from mastodon.social to <a href=\"https://social.lol\">social.lol</a>. Luckily that went really smoothly. It was a lot of fun getting involved, configuring everything and thinking about what it&rsquo;s even good for 🤦‍♂️.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, I continued to work with the <a href=\"https://www.ankermake.com/eu-en\">AnkerMake M5</a>, which also arrived after a very long wait at the beginning of December. All in all I&rsquo;m very happy with the 3D printer, but still don&rsquo;t really know what got into me back in early 2022 when I backed it on Kickstarter. But that is definitely going too far at this point and maybe I&rsquo;ll go into more detail elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Well, micro.blog is kind of a universe in itself too. In addition to choosing a <a href=\"https://social.lol/@muhh/109652832580041607\">theme</a>, there is of course the client question. I got some for iOS (the official <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1253201335\">app</a>, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1437753701\">Gluon for Micro.blog</a> and MacOS (<a href=\"https://redsweater.com/marsedit\">MarsEdit 5</a>, which I use via <a href=\"https://setapp.com\">Setapp</a>) looked at various editors (<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ia-writer/id775737172\">iA Writer</a>, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/drafts/id1236254471\">Drafts</a> and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/runestone-text-editor/id1548193893\">Runestone</a>. In addition, there are useful tools as <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696\">Mimi Uploader</a> (iOS) to upload images and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1592173492\">Epilogue for Micro.blog</a> to track books, but I&rsquo;m just starting out here, there are just too many apps and I have to see which ones &ldquo;click&rdquo; for me.</p>\n<p>There are of course all sorts of little helpers for publishing interesting links and posts on Mastodon or blog entries. Among others <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/linky-for-twitter-and-mastodon/id438090426\">Linky</a> and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/re-toot/id1661697436\">Re: Toot</a> by <a href=\"https://social.lol/@simonbs@mastodon.social\">Simon B. Støvring</a> (who, by the way, is also responsible for Runestone) I would like to mention at this point.</p>\n<p>As if all that wasn&rsquo;t enough, at the beginning of last week, after a 1.5 year wait, I received my long-awaited <a href=\"https://play.date\">playdate</a> game console. (In the meantime I had actually already forgotten that I had even ordered it and I was all the happier that it suddenly arrived.) It&rsquo;s a lot of fun to deal with the little yellow box and I wanted to jot down some impressions I got. I rented a domain with Wordpress installed last year already and tried a few things with <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">micro.blog</a> but didn&rsquo;t really publish anything on either platform. This year I wanted to change that and thus started with a <a href=\"https://esamecar.de/2023/01/07/playdate.html\">post about the playdate</a>.</p>\n<p>All in all, it was an exciting time in terms of IT. Now all of a sudden I somehow have <a href=\"https://esamecar.de/2023/01/07/hello-world.html\">three blogs</a> and will soon have to concentrate on one of them and see when everyday work starts again tomorrow, whether I still have the time and, above all, the desire to continue writing down my thoughts, or these escapades were again one of my &ldquo;manic&rdquo; excursions into something new and I would lose interest again the day after tomorrow - which would be a pity.</p>\n<p>So, maybe cu next week 🙋‍♂️</p>\n<p>PS: initally, I wanted to talk a little bit about the music and podcasts I&rsquo;ve listened to, too but this post is already way too long.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>Update 22.01.2023: It <!-- raw HTML omitted -->seems like<!-- raw HTML omitted --> he is not actively developing it right now.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n",

And then, coincidentally, I signed up for the service with thousands of other people ([who must have read a post on Hacker News](https://omglol.news/2023/01/07/wildest-36-hours-ever) and not otaviocc's post 😎). \nOn omg.lol you ultimately get a \"funny\" address on the web that contains a wide variety of small services. A single page website (to use as a [business card](https://esamecar.omg.lol)), a [statuslog](http://esamecar.status.lol), an omg.lol-email address (forwarder), different DNS services, pastebin, PURL service, a [weblog](http://esamecar.weblog.lol) (beta), etc. And while I was at it anyways, I also have my [Mastodon](https://social.lol/@esamecar) account moved from mastodon.social to [social.lol](https://social.lol). Luckily that went really smoothly. It was a lot of fun getting involved, configuring everything and thinking about what it's even good for 🤦‍♂️.\n\nIn the meantime, I continued to work with the [AnkerMake M5](https://www.ankermake.com/eu-en), which also arrived after a very long wait at the beginning of December. All in all I'm very happy with the 3D printer, but still don't really know what got into me back in early 2022 when I backed it on Kickstarter. But that is definitely going too far at this point and maybe I'll go into more detail elsewhere.\n\nWell, micro.blog is kind of a universe in itself too. In addition to choosing a [theme](https://social.lol/@muhh/109652832580041607), there is of course the client question. I got some for iOS (the official [app](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1253201335), [Gluon for Micro.blog](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1437753701) and MacOS ([MarsEdit 5](https://redsweater.com/marsedit), which I use via [Setapp](https://setapp.com)) looked at various editors ([iA Writer](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ia-writer/id775737172), [Drafts](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/drafts/id1236254471) and [Runestone](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/runestone-text-editor/id1548193893). In addition, there are useful tools as [Mimi Uploader](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696) (iOS) to upload images and [Epilogue for Micro.blog](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1592173492) to track books, but I'm just starting out here, there are just too many apps and I have to see which ones \"click\" for me.\n\nThere are of course all sorts of little helpers for publishing interesting links and posts on Mastodon or blog entries. Among others [Linky](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/linky-for-twitter-and-mastodon/id438090426) and [Re: Toot](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/re-toot/id1661697436) by [Simon B. Støvring](https://social.lol/@simonbs@mastodon.social) (who, by the way, is also responsible for Runestone) I would like to mention at this point.\n\nAs if all that wasn't enough, at the beginning of last week, after a 1.5 year wait, I received my long-awaited [playdate](https://play.date) game console. (In the meantime I had actually already forgotten that I had even ordered it and I was all the happier that it suddenly arrived.) It's a lot of fun to deal with the little yellow box and I wanted to jot down some impressions I got. I rented a domain with Wordpress installed last year already and tried a few things with [micro.blog](https://micro.blog) but didn't really publish anything on either platform. This year I wanted to change that and thus started with a [post about the playdate](https://esamecar.de/2023/01/07/playdate.html).\n\nAll in all, it was an exciting time in terms of IT. Now all of a sudden I somehow have [three blogs](https://esamecar.de/2023/01/07/hello-world.html) and will soon have to concentrate on one of them and see when everyday work starts again tomorrow, whether I still have the time and, above all, the desire to continue writing down my thoughts, or these escapades were again one of my \"manic\" excursions into something new and I would lose interest again the day after tomorrow - which would be a pity.\n\nSo, maybe cu next week 🙋‍♂️\n\nPS: initally, I wanted to talk a little bit about the music and podcasts I've listened to, too but this post is already way too long.\n\n[^1]: Update 22.01.2023: It <a href=\"https://chaos.social/@343max/109721280698325235\">seems like</a> he is not actively developing it right now.\n\n",

				"content_text": "<h1>What I have done in the first week of 2023  (teaser: mastodon, omg.lol, playdate, ankermake)</h1>\n<p>I was motivated by <a href=\"https://micro.blog/muhh\">muhh</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.byzero.de/2023/01/08/week-its-a.html\">blog entry</a> to write down what was on my mind in the first week of January. I'm not sure yet if this will become something more regular, but I wanted to start putting something online more often anyway - more on that below.</p>\n<p>I've had the last two weeks off. The weather was bad, I had a cold 🤧 and therefore a lot of cycling wasn't an option either (at least that's what I told myself). So, I used the time to hang out at the computer a little more than usally. There was a lot of exciting things to discover there. \nSomehow Elon started this with the downfall of twitter, which he initiated. I had only been there reading for years anyway, and then after the takeover I decided to download my data, delete the clients on my end devices and no longer use the account.</p>\n<p>As an alternative, I was of course interested in Mastodon and clicked an account on the standard instance <a href=\"https://mastodon.social\">mastodon.social</a>. Thanks to tools like <a href=\"https://www.movetodon.org\">movetodon</a> and <a href=\"https://glitch.com/~fedifinder\">fedifinder</a> my timeline has also filled up pretty quickly, and I actually \"met\" pretty quickly some real people with whom you could exchange ideas in a friendly manner. All in all a very positive experience.</p>\n<p>One great thing about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse\">fediverse </a> is the extreme dynamics of the tools and clients that are currently being built around it. It feels like back in the early days of Twitter where, for example, a single programmer, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loren_Brichter\">Loren Brichter</a>, with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweetie\">Tweetie</a> could turn the whole twitter landscape upside down. (BTW he only has an <a href=\"https://mastodon.cloud/@loren\">inactive account</a> on Mastodon 😢) </p>\n<p>I tried countless clients over a few days. Among others (unsorted)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ice Cubes for Mastodon (<a href=\"https://testflight.apple.com/join/tqI3dK1u\">beta</a>) by <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@dimillian\">@dimillian</a> (<a href=\"@icecubesapp@mastodon.cloud\">@icecubesapp</a>),</li>\n<li>Mammoth: for Mastodon (<a href=\"https://testflight.apple.com/join/HyL7boSn\">beta</a>) by <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@JPEGuin\">@JPEGuin@mastodon.social</a>,</li>\n<li>Wolly for Mastodon (<a href=\"https://testflight.apple.com/join/2LVAJQTP\">beta</a>) by <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@mttvll\">Matteo</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mastoot/id1501485410\">Mastoot</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mastodon/id1571998974\">Mastodon</a> (official app),</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/toot/id1229021451\">Toot!</a> (on <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@tootapp\">Mastodon</a>),</li>\n<li>Komondor (beta) by <a href=\"https://chaos.social/@343max\">@343max@chaos.social</a>, and</li>\n<li>Ivory (beta; officially alpha ;-)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The official app is okay, but IMHO not great; toot! I liked the range of functions very much, but you also have to cope with the strange design somehow. Because I follow some accounts that post a lot, and since the timeline on Mastodon is not orchestrated by any algorithms, posts from other people are in danger of being lost. Thats why a good list function is very important to me personally. There, Mammoth also makes a very good impression, but in the end I was lucky and was able to test <a href=\"https://tapbots.social/@ivory\">Ivory</a> via Testflight. The app by <a href=\"https://tapbots.social/@paul\">Paul Haddad</a> and <a href=\"https://tapbots.social/@mark\">Mark Jardine</a> has an button design that is a bit too playful for my taste, but otherwise it is extremely stable and really great at everything it does.

I ordered it in July 2021 and finally received it a mere 1.5 years later. Since then I’ve really enjoyed the console. Every animation, every sound somehow expresses the joy and dedication that Cable Sasser and his team at <a href=\"https://panic.com/\">Panic</a> evidently put into the development of this – while <a href=\"https://shop.play.date/\">rather expensive</a> piece of hardware.</p>\n<p>I really like the first two games of <a href=\"https://play.date/games/\">Series 1</a> so far and they couldn’t be more different. <a href=\"https://play.date/games/whitewater-wipeout/\">Whitewater Wipeout</a> is quite a challenging game of skill in the spirit of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/o_2S5CSc97M \">California Games</a>, which I played with friends for hours on the C64 and immediately brought back fond memories. The game makes very good use of the crank. At first I was happy about 200 points, meanwhile it’s a few thousand and my sons, who grew up with graphically bombastic touchscreen games on iPad and Co. or complex titles on the PS4, also liked it straight away and now fill the high score. However, how you can achieve several million points in this game will probably always remain a mystery to me.</p>\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.racemat.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/CleanShot-2023-01-07-at-12.14.32.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Whitewater Wipeout Highscore on playdate\" border= \"0\" width=\"200\" />\n<p><a href=\"https://play.date/games/casual-birder/\">Casual Birder</a> is „a snap-‚em-all adventure set in beautiful seaside Bird Town“ and also entertaining. However, I haven’t really progressed very far here.</p>\n<p>I’m definitely looking forward to the next 20 games that are included in the purchase price, which also puts it into perspective, and I’m excited for the upcoming <a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch/TW2SHhYw0Vo?t=536\" >store</a> (aka <a href=\"https://playdate-wiki.com/wiki/Catalog\">catalog</a>).</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, you can load your own games and applications onto the device via USB or a website (called <a href=\"https://play.date/account/sideload/\">sideload</a>). A probably almost complete overview of all projects can be found on the <a href=\"https://playdate-wiki.com/wiki/Main_Page\">playdate community wiki</a>. The games are often offered on <a href=\"https://itch.io/games/tag-playdate\">itch.io</a> and usually cost somewhere between $1 and $10.</p>\n<p>So far I’ve been into <a href=\"https://rngpartygames.itch.io/bloom\">Bloom</a>, „a real-time narrative-driven social sim about starting up a flower shop“ and <a href =\"https://possiblyaxolotl.itch.io/rocketbytes\">Rocket Bytes</a>, „a 1-bit precision rocket flying reverse platformer“. The former is just plain nice, the latter hard as hell. Other games I would like to check out are <a href=\"https://ronlent.itch.io/eyeland\">EYELAND</a>, <a href=\"https://gingerbeardman.itch.io /daily-driver\">Daily Driver (Tech Demo)</a> and <a href=\"https://frankbsadgames.itch.io/a-balanced-brew\">A Balanced Brew</a>. And if you have a dollar left over, you can also buy <a href=\"https://kamibox.itch.io/a-joke-thats-worth-099\">A Joke Thats Worth $0.99</a> for a smile.</p>\n<p>As if that weren’t enough, Panic has an app called <a href=\"https://play.date/mirror/\">Mirror</a> that allows games to be streamed and recorded directly to a monitor. <a href=\"https://help.play.date/games/mirror/#key-uses\">Accessibility</a> has also been considered. And then of course there’s the <a href=\"https://play.date/dev/\">development environment</a>, once in professional and as if that wasn’t enough, also a comprehensive <a href=\"https ://play.date/pulp/\">web editor</a>, with which you can develop really professional games in the browser.</p>\n<p>It was also a good thing that I have been the happy owner of an <a href=\"https://www.ankermake.com/eu-en\">AnkerMake M5</a> since December 2022, so I was able to get a suitable <a href=\"https://www.printables.com/de/model/226801-magnetic-cover-for-playdate/files\">Magnetic Cover</a>, because unfortunately I didn’t have the official <a href=\" https://shop.play.date\">ordered</a> and now the shipping would be more expensive than the case itself ;-(</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://www.racemat.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8156-1.jpeg\" alt=\"3d printed magnetic cover for playdate\" title=\"IMG_8156.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"150\" /></p>\n<p>I’m excited to see how the little yellow part will continue, I’m looking forward to regular game updates for the next eleven weeks and at the same time I’ll be listening to the official <a href=\"https://podcast.play.date/\">podcast</a>. Long story short: for me personally a really compelling overall package.</p>\n",
