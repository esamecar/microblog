			 <p>I was using the new <a href="https://reeder.app">Reeder</a> app for the last couple of months, but today I quit. For my number of subscribed feeds, it simply takes far too long to refresh. And, there are bugs, there is no support, and there is not even an OPML export feature. So, I purchased <a href="https://www.lireapp.com">lire</a> and set it up with <a href="https://feedbin.com">Feedbin</a>, a service I was not using before either. I&rsquo;m curious to see what will come of this.</p>

			 <p>As an enthusiastic <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> user, over time I‚Äôve built a rather complex system consisting of about 15 different shortcuts that are triggered sequentially by a master shortcut. At the end of each day, these shortcuts collect data from various apps and add them to my daily notes in Obsidian. It was undoubtedly a challenge to develop this system, and without the <a href="https://apps.icymi.lol/post/actions-for-obsidian">Actions for Obsidian</a> plugin, it would have been impossible. It‚Äôs definitely not elegant, but rather a bit of a hack, though it worked wonderfully for the past six months or so.</p>
<p>Despite my love for Obsidian, I must admit that the difficulty of importing data into the app, along with the non-native user interface, represents its biggest drawback. Nevertheless, I was extremely satisfied with my solution‚Äîuntil iOS 18 came along.</p>
<p>With the update to iOS 18, my carefully crafted system broke down. About half to a third of my shortcuts stopped working correctly. The errors occur mainly with internal iOS functions but also in conjunction with integrated actions from third-party apps like <a href="https://chroniclingapp.com">Chronicling</a>. But it&rsquo;s obviously Apple who broke it and there is nothing the developers can do about it at the moment. Every error causes the shortcut to stop entirely. <em>Rien ne va plus</em>‚Äînothing works anymore. Over the past few weeks, I‚Äôve spent a lot of time looking for workarounds, disabled certain functions but at the end I came to the conclusion that running the shortcuts on my Mac, which I haven‚Äôt updated yet, worked the most reliably‚Äîeven though this introduced new challenges to my workflow, as certain apps just aren‚Äôt available there. (Looking at you, Apple Health.)</p>
<p>This situation has made me reflect. I even considered switching back to the native Notes app from Obsidian. Partly because I also wanted to take a look at <a href="https://www.myforevernotes.com">Forever ‚ú± Notes</a>, which has made the rounds through the Fediverse in recent days. It‚Äôs paradoxical: Apple‚Äôs poor software quality is driving me to avoid third-party software and return to Apple‚Äôs own apps?! No, that can‚Äôt be the solution. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
<p>For now, I‚Äôve given up and am hoping for iOS 18.1. Next year, I‚Äôll probably hold off on updating <a href="https://social.lol/@esamecar/113136977472135502">not just my Mac</a> but also my phone to the new release.</p>

			 <p>In recent days, a lot of new hardware has been introduced, and for all these great new devices and gadgets, I consider myself part of the potential target audience. Apple has presented new <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-16-pro/">iPhones</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-10/">Apple Watches</a>, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-4/">AirPods</a>. Thanks to Apple&rsquo;s decision to slowly and gradually roll out the promised AI features and not at all in Germany in the long run, the innovations of the iPhone 16 are limited for me. Therefore, I have decided to use my iPhone 14 Pro for another year, especially since I was recently able to replace the battery thanks to Apple Care. So far, I always had the Pro model, but this year, for the first time, I had the impression that it is actually aimed at professional photographers/videographers, and I no longer belong to the target audience. If I were to order a new device today, I would choose the regular iPhone, and who knows, maybe I&rsquo;ll get lucky, and next year the iPhone 17 will even have Always On. That would probably be the only feature I would really miss. (120 Hz is guaranteed to be great, but I actually don&rsquo;t see the difference in daily use; which in my case is an advantage.)
It&rsquo;s similar with my Apple Watch. Although I could justify a new one, since my Series 7 is now almost three years old, I recently got to replace the battery and see no urgent need for an upgrade. I&rsquo;m already eyeing the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-ultra-2/">Ultra</a> anyway, and this time it hasn&rsquo;t received any technical improvements. And since I already own AirPods Pro Gen 2, I followed the announcement of the AirPods 4 with interest, but there is no risk of FOMO ü•≥.</p>
<p>Apart from Apple, the new <a href="https://www.goretroid.com/products/retroid-pocket-5-handheld?srsltid=AfmBOop5cCQYozTUgHs2R5uHEt03ow-9gJZDIWctOSNETsQYrNdd2lJP">Retroid Pocket 5</a> and <a href="https://www.goretroid.com/collections/retro-game-system/products/retroid-pocket-mini-handheld">Retroid Pocket Mini</a> have been announced. Despite my interest in a dedicated retro handheld with an OLED display, my <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/">Steam Deck OLED</a> and the other devices I already own are enough for now. The constant new hardware releases in this area are increasingly annoying me. When ordering, you already know that you&rsquo;ll be presented with a slightly improved device in a couple of weeks. The manufacturers don&rsquo;t allow you to have the feeling of truly owning the perfect device for even a minute, and it gives the impression that they are deliberately putting imperfect handhelds on the market üò°.</p>
<p>Speaking of retro and must-have: <a href="https://www.analogue.co/editions/pocket-gbc-colors">Analog Pocket</a> has announced a new special edition. This time, there are beautiful GBC colors at the usual prices and not totally overpriced <a href="https://www.analogue.co/editions/pocket-aluminum">aluminium models</a>. Although it tempts me, I try to curb my collector&rsquo;s instinct üòÖ.</p>
<p>The announcement of the <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6HaRMiTfvks">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> initially triggered me as well, but I came to the conclusion that my current PS5 in combination with my <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/monitors/27-to-31-5-inches/rog-swift-oled-pg32ucdm/">4K OLED gaming monitor</a> is completely sufficient. Spending ‚Ç¨800 for slightly better graphics is something I actually can&rsquo;t justify to myself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different with the Switch 2. I&rsquo;m curious and will probably buy it, provided Nintendo doesn&rsquo;t make any major mistakes ü§û.</p>

			 <p>I think we now live in a time where people don&rsquo;t really wonder about things like usernames anymore. But maybe some of you have wondered about mine?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only been using <em><strong>esamecar</strong></em> for two or three years. Before that, I had a series of others, but for most services, I usually used the same one at the same time. I still somehow remember two of them. As a child or teenager, I naturally wanted a username that mainly sounded cool. Any appended numbers, like year of birth, were an absolute no-go for me. I&rsquo;ve also never really been a fan of l33t speech. So the options were a little more limited. But, initially, it wasn&rsquo;t necessary for my username to be globally unique. It was enough if it wasn&rsquo;t used in the BBS network or in the Usenet groups where you were active. I believe, but I&rsquo;m not 100% sure anymore, that I came up with <em>Zodiac</em> at the beginning of my BBS days and then years later realized that there were other people on Usenet who were much more well-known than me and had the same name. So I needed a new one.</p>
<p>After that, I had the username <em>paxton</em> for what feels like decades. I was a big fan of Bill Paxton from a specific, quite well-known sci-fi movie. But there were already others who had made a name for themselves earlier in the world wide web, and I don&rsquo;t mean the actor, who probably wasn&rsquo;t really hanging around in the interwebs at those times.</p>
<p>Therefore, I was looking for the next username and, because I became a scientist, decided on &ldquo;Racemase&rdquo;. <em>Racemase</em> sounds like an artificial term, many Americans pronounce it like &ldquo;Race Maze&rdquo;. But it&rsquo;s actually the German term for an enzyme from the group of isomerases that enables the conversion between the two enantiomers of a substance. Anyway.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly when and why, but I probably messed up and registered one or two accounts with this username and then forgot that I did and couldn&rsquo;t remember the email address I was using for password recovery. Suddenly, I wasn&rsquo;t able (re)register for those online communities with my chosen username when my interest returned. So I needed something new again, as I don&rsquo;t wanted to be racemase68 on PSN.</p>
<p>And since I was very uncreative, I simply started writing <em>racemase</em> backwards, and now I often use this completely artificial word <em>esamecar</em> as an username for English-speaking communities and continue to use <em>racemase</em> for German-speaking ones. Let&rsquo;s see how long that lasts.</p>
<p>Now, you know ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£.</p>

<p>üå°Ô∏è For many months now I bake bread (yeast and sourdough) several times a week.  I distrusted the temperature display of our oven and was therefore looking for a reasonable  thermometer I can place inside my oven. I came to the conclusion, that this is one of those <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/07/29/there-are-a.html">categories of items</a> for which there is only trash available to purchase. Ultimately, I bought the meat thermometer <a href="https://store-us.meater.com/#">Meater 2 plus</a>. I suspect that my Meater will never see the inside of a raw piece of meat and I dislike their target group marketing  and even more dislike their advertising campaign (woman lets food burn and star chef, of course a man, rushes to help ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) BUT I still found the product very interesting. My Meater now measures the dough temperature, supposedly to the decimal point. (The reading of the ambient temperature seems to be completely off as well but the internal readings seem to be awesome.) It does leave an ugly hole in the bread, but the endpoint (96-98 ¬∞C, depending on the dough) can be determined pretty well. (For the first loaves, it was 5 - 10 minutes longer than the maximum duration stated in the recipe; so I have already learned something about our oven.)<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>

<li>
<p>üëã After actively ignoring Gruber in my podcast and RSS feed as well as social media for a while, I have now deleted all sources.</p>

<li>
<p>üïπÔ∏è DOOM + DOOM II was <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/doom-doomii-release-notes?linkId=100000279162898">released</a> - <em>The legendary action FPS is enhanced, combined, and now available on modern platforms</em>! Nice move: <em>Existing owners of DOOM (1993) and/or DOOM II on any of the above platforms receive a free upgrade to the new combined game, and can still access their previously owned versions</em>. So, I could download the new version for my Steam Deck, Switch, and PS5 for free. (Of course, I own a legal copy of Doom and Doom II for all these platforms.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With macOS Sequoia this fall, using apps that need access to screen recording permissions will become a little bit more tedious. Apple is rolling out a change that will require you to give explicit permission on a weekly basis to these types of apps, and every time you reboot your Mac.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really hope this gets sorted out during the beta phase; otherwise, I will try to stay on Sonoma as long as possible. For years now, I&rsquo;ve been waiting to upgrade until at least the first .1 release because Apple&rsquo;s software quality hasn&rsquo;t exactly inspired confidence. Additionally, Sequoia only has one new feature that genuinely interests me: iPhone Mirroring. And this won&rsquo;t be available for EU users initially anyway. (The integrated AI stuff doesn&rsquo;t interest me on the Mac at all, so I&rsquo;m not sad about not having it in my operating system for the foreseeable future. I think it will be several years before it&rsquo;s useful for anything until then I just use third party app for ChatGPT.)</p>

<p>The idea of approving these weekly or after every restart is not very appealing to me. Additionally, Apple apparently plans to make running apps installed from outside the App Store more <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/06/macos-sequoia-gatekeeper-security-change/">difficult</a>. Thanks a lot for nothing.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s wait and see ü§û.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In continuation of week <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/07/28/what-caught-my.html">30</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the thirty-first week of 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>üñºÔ∏è I&rsquo;ve mentioned the image viewers <a href="https://apps.icymi.lol/post/lyn-for-macos">Lyn</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/picarrange/id1530678223?mt=12">PicArrange</a> before, but this week <a href="https://brushedpixel.com/musebox/">Musebox</a> made the rounds. I will take a closer look at it when I get a chance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üîÑ Speaking of alternatives: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/diffraction-image-editor/id1544476110?mt=12">Diffraction</a> might be a (currently free) alternative to <a href="https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/">Acorn</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üîç And if you only want to find (even the smallest) differences between two images, you can check out <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imagediff-compare-images/id6504044598?mt=12">ImageDiff</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üñ•Ô∏è Somehow, mini apps for the Dynamic Island of various MacBooks were making the rounds this week. I came across <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imagediff-compare-images/id6504044598?mt=12">NotchDrop</a> (FOSS), <a href="https://wouter01.github.io/MediaMate/">MediaMate</a> ($7), <a href="https://lo.cafe/notchnook">Notchnook</a> ($25), and <a href="https://www.dynamiclake.com">DynamicLake Pro</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> ($14). Since I mostly use my MacBooks with larger monitors, I currently don&rsquo;t need these apps. But maybe in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üåê There is a <a href="https://iosdev.space/@podomunro/112904952036549544">public beta</a> for S√∂ka 2.0 available if you&rsquo;re interested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìë <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/goodlinks/id1474335294">GoodLinks</a> also received an update and now supports highlighting text on web pages after subscribing via IAP. Since I am very happy with <a href="https://readwise.io/read">Readwise Reader</a>, which admittedly is very expensive, I don&rsquo;t need it. If I weren&rsquo;t, I would definitely take a closer look at this feature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì± Many people were excited about <a href="https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/2024/07/unread-for-mac-available-now/">Unread for Mac</a>. I don&rsquo;t want another subscription and will stick with <a href="https://www.reederapp.com">Reeder</a> for now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì∞ Speaking of RSS, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iconfactory/project-tapestry">Tapestry</a> is slowly taking shape and looks promising. However, the concept only works for me with a very limited selection of resources, and I find it very difficult to choose the right ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìÅ <a href="https://magnumbytes.com/">Nimble Commander</a> - <em>Free dual-pane mac file manager with classic design, charged for power users</em>. A possible alternative for those who don&rsquo;t have a license for <a href="https://binarynights.com">Forklift</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, <a href="https://www.cocoatech.io">Path Finder</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, or <a href="https://commander-one.com">Commander One</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üîç There are <a href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/file-finding-apps">countless different apps</a> that help you find files on your Mac in addition to Spotlight. There is now another free app that promises to do just that: <a href="https://pixel-master.github.io/File-Find/">File Find by Pixel-Master</a> - <em>Search and find files fast and easily</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üé® This looks cool: <a href="https://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama">Pixelorama</a> - <em>a powerful and accessible open-source pixel art multitool</em>. Unfortunately, I am not talented enough to use such an app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚òî <a href="https://norden.social/@czottmann/112876834666236060">Carlo</a> discovered <a href="https://merrysky.net">Merry Sky</a>. Looks cool, too and like a free, supercharged web version of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/en/app/looks-like-rain/id6443960587">Looks Like Rain</a>. Well, probably the other way round - but what the heck üòá.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ I like the idea of a game controller that can be used with your mobile phone and a Nintendo Switch: <a href="https://www.gamesir.hk/products/g8plus-bluetooth-mobile-controller">GameSir G8 Plus Bluetooth Mobile Controller</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ü§¶ I first thought it was a joke because it&rsquo;s so cringe: <a href="https://www.friend.com/product.html">Friend</a>. Maybe they just want to get the addresses of people who urgently need psychological support? (They already have their own addresses, though.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéß I was about to throw away our Beats Solo3 because the ear pads were starting to disintegrate. Luckily, I learned that you can buy <a href="https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0BTL5C32J/">replacements</a> very cheaply and mount them yourself. And If I had studied the instructions more carefully, I wouldn&rsquo;t have almost destroyed them during the process ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üíç There were increasing rumours this week about <a href="https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2024/07/the-apple-ring-and-health-tracking/">The Apple Ring and Health Tracking</a>, presumably in response to Samsung&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.samsung.com/uk/rings/galaxy-ring/galaxy-ring-titanium-black-size-10-sm-q500nzkaeub/">Ring</a>. I would also find such a device very attractive. After my first COVID-19 infection at the end of last year and the resulting break in my streak of closing my rings every day for several years, I&rsquo;m no longer as keen on achieving this, but I still pay attention to them. On the other hand, I&rsquo;m getting bored with the design of my Apple Watch(es), which I&rsquo;ve been wearing on my wrist for almost 18 years now. Therefore, some <em>variety</em> in the form of other watches or none at all would certainly be welcome. Samsung will surely not integrate its Ring into the Apple Health universe (although this would probably be possible even without DMA). So, I just have to wait for Apple or just ignore my rings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üö¥ Due to my wife&rsquo;s shoulder surgery, we unfortunately had to cancel our vacation. We will now have to go hiking in the French Alps another time. However, I still took three days off from work and did what I would have done on vacation: ate very well, read a <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/08/03/finished-reading-der.html">book</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, finished a <a href="https://social.lol/@esamecar/112905362772124060">game</a> on my Switch, but spent only little time on the computer overall. Oh yes, I finally went for a bike ride again, which I hadn&rsquo;t had time or motivation for lately.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a wonderful week ahead! üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

			 <p>In continuation of week <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/07/21/what-caught-my.html">29</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the thirtieth week of 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>üìù Might be handy, but not sure if I will actually use it: <a href="https://weexpire.org/">WeExpire</a> - <em>Create emergency notes that can be read by your trusted contacts only after your death</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üñ•Ô∏è <a href="https://www.mothersruin.com/software/Apparency/">Apparency</a> for macOS - <em>The App That Opens Apps</em> - received a nice update at the beginning of the month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üñºÔ∏è <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/picarrange/id1530678223?mt=12">PicArrange</a> for macOS as well; although I have not yet found whether the text-based image search happens on-device or sends anything to the cloud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ü§ñ Meta released Llama 3.1 and it does indeed produce much better results with e.g. <a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üåê <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/24/apple-maps-web-beta-now-available/">Apple Maps launches on the web in new public beta</a> - practical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ Along with a few <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@altstore/112842555810648093">new applications</a>, Fortnite is now even coming to the <a href="https://mastodon.social/@rileytestut/112848981069946420">AltStore PAL</a>. Let&rsquo;s see if Apple will &ldquo;coincidentally&rdquo; allow it back in the regular App Store. It&rsquo;s also a shame that Apple has managed to make the update and installation process so broken on my system that it barely works without restarting or reinstalling the AltStore or the apps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÅ The German computer magazine <a href="https://www.heise.de/select/ct/2024/17">c&rsquo;t</a> had a review of the <a href="https://wowcube.com/">WOWCUBE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM</a> - a very cool idea. Maybe a possible Christmas gift? I&rsquo;m curious whether their software platform will flop or survive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üî† Might come handy someday: <a href="https://anagrams.io/">Free Anagram Sentence Generator for English, German, French, and Spanish</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚úÖ I&rsquo;ve mentioned <a href="https://onemillioncheckboxes.com/">One Million Checkboxes</a> in <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/07/08/what-caught-my.html">week 27</a>, here you can read a little bit more about the author&rsquo;s journey <a href="http://eieio.games/essays/scaling-one-million-checkboxes/">Dealing with unexpected popularity</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üó≥Ô∏è My Mastodon timeline has become much more interested in American politics since certain events. I follow this with some interest. However, I couldn&rsquo;t initially understand the sudden memes about a certain person&rsquo;s couch. Thanks to <a href="https://ftw.usatoday.com/2024/07/jd-vance-couch-memes-associated-press">JD Vance couch memes, explained: Why AP pulled its story</a>, now I know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üöë My wife had shoulder surgery again. It&rsquo;s no fun; now six weeks of complete rest are prescribed, and we really hope that the collarbone, or rather the implanted metal plate, holds this time. We had to cancel our vacation because of this. It&rsquo;s a shame, but her health definitely comes first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üß± I have quite a huge <a href="https://brickset.com/sets/ownedby-racemase">LEGO collection</a> (&gt; 700 sets and &gt; 2200 minifigs) but stopped collecting a while ago, mainly due to space constraints and of course because it was becoming increasingly expensive. But I might be tempted by this set: <a href="https://brickset.com/sets/71438-1">LEGO 71438 Super Mario World: Mario &amp; Yoshi</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üïπÔ∏è I&rsquo;ve preordered <a href="https://thankgoodness.game/">Thank Goodness You&rsquo;re Here!</a> for the Switch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ Of course, I am enjoying <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Nintendo-World-Championships-NES-Edition-2569575.html">Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</a> on my Switch quite a bit and found this <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/rewards/feba38a937fd6b81">guide</a> helpful. You can download a free PDF copy if you have a myNintendo account. Additionally, I am currently playing the remake of <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dead-space/dead-space?setLocale=en-gb">Dead Space</a> on the PS5.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üé• And fittingly: Watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6718170/">The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a> - it was very light entertainment, but not bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì∫ I think someday I should really watch all episodes of <a href="https://youtu.be/kRlI72bsNRc?si=bh9hWQM4np7hSv0r">Double Fine PsychOdyssey</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I wish you lovely summer days! üåû</p>

			 <p>In continuation of week <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/07/14/what-caught-my.html">28</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the twenty-ninth week of 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>üì± Just in time for its <a href="https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite">tenth anniversary</a> the rewrite of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/overcast/id888422857">Overcast</a> was released. I had canceled my subscription months ago, but since it hasn&rsquo;t expired yet, I downloaded the new version and used it over the past week. It seems significantly more performant than before, but its UI is still confusing. I think I&rsquo;ll switch back to Apple&rsquo;s Podcast App, which I am also not really satisfied with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìë With <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/showdown-presentation/id6504288864?mt=12">Showdown</a>, a free presentation app based on Markdown has been released. I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="https://www.deckset.com">Deckset</a> for a while, and then there&rsquo;s <a href="https://hyperdeck.io/index.html">Hyperdeck</a> or, of course, <a href="https://ia.net/presenter">iA Presenter</a>, all of which can do similar things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì± The first beta of <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iconfactory/project-tapestry">Tapestry</a> for iOS by the <a href="https://iconfactory.com">Iconfactory</a> was distributed to Kickstarter backers; it is still just a concept; I am curious to see how it develops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ü§ñ Sindre&rsquo;s <a href="https://sindresorhus.com/ai-actions">AI Actions</a> for the Shortcuts app now supports GPT-4o mini.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üçå <a href="https://bananabin.app">BananaBin</a> was released in version 1.0 and here you can find some other <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/weird-but-useful-mac-apps">weird but useful macOS apps</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üîã The battery capacity of my iPhone 14 Pro was down to 79% after just 1.5 years, so I used Apple&rsquo;s Express Replacement Service through Apple Care+. You have to hand it to Apple, I had the replacement device in my hands the next day. The migration went quite well. My second prepaid eSIM was not as easy to transfer, but it was eventually reactivated. But guess what didn&rsquo;t work afterward? Altstore PAL along with Delta and Clip<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. A knave who thinks ill of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üöë My wife had a collarbone fracture a few weeks ago, had to undergo surgery, and now has a plate inside her. About a week ago, she suddenly experienced severe pain again. It turned out that two screws had come loose. Now she has to be operated on again. I feel very sorry for her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üî™ The new <a href="https://www.victorinox.com/en-GB/Products/Swiss-Army-Knives/Medium-Pocket-Knives/Farmer-X-Alox-Damast-Limited-Edition-2024/p/0.8271.J24">Victorinox Damast Limited Edition 2024</a> was released. Additionally, as a big Victorinox fan, I found this <a href="https://youtu.be/_jOcOtwhlP8?si=3lhGnywRjOWmEPG_">video</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JonGadget">Jon Gadget</a> interesting. He was invited to the company headquarters after he had posted a <a href="https://youtu.be/WRMDpSIvjxs?si=3Wgrqg8YMqqIl6JR">critical video</a> some time ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ Continued my journey in <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Link-s-Awakening-1514327.html">The Legend of Zelda: Link&rsquo;s Awakening</a> .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üåê Enjoyed <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/everybodys-free-to-make-websites/">Everybody&rsquo;s Free (to Make Websites)</a>, even though I didn&rsquo;t even know the <a href="https://music.apple.com/de/album/everybodys-free-to-wear-sunscreen-full-mix/260071971?i=260072003">original</a> before.</p>

<p>I wish you all a wonderful week and perhaps even relaxing holidays! üå¥</p>

<p>üí∏ There was another series of discounts for software from indie developers as part of the <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/07/09/indieappsales-sommer.html">IndieAppSales</a>. This time I didn&rsquo;t go overboard like at the beginning of the year, but there were still a few very nice new apps to discover.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üí∞ Speaking of discounts, <a href="https://indieapps.space/@skoro/112777672976130526">Skoro 3.0</a> is still available at a reduced price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üçé Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/13/24198015/apple-utm-se-pc-os-emulator-for-ios">has approved</a> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/utm-se-retro-pc-emulator/id1564628856">UTM SE</a> for iOS on the App Store.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì± Many people in my Apple bubble are impressed by this really cheap and very stylish Android <a href="https://nothing.tech/pages/cmf-store">mobile phone</a>. Instead of a used iPhone, I might also buy a CMF Phone 1 for one of my sons if the need suddenly arose. A few years ago, this would have been unthinkable for me. BTW, since the end of last week, the Vision Pro is now available in Germany, and I haven&rsquo;t even thought about checking out the device in person. That would have been unthinkable a few years ago, too. Due to what I believe to be very poor software quality lately, their behavior towards developers, and childish actions against the EU&rsquo;s demands, Apple has actually managed to kill any interest I had in new devices from Cupertino. What a shame üò¢.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà <a href="https://nileane.fr/@nileane/112774121937194544">Nil√©ane</a> from MacStories published an article about her impression that <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/lgbt-and-marginalized-voices-are-not-welcome-on-threads/">LGBT and Marginalized Voices Are Not Welcome on Threads</a>. <a href="https://nileane.fr/@nileane/112774656837852705">She</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.macstories.net/@viticci/112774756298562226">Federico</a> received the unfortunately expected feedback directly. I don&rsquo;t understand why people have such a problem with others just being different from them. What are they afraid of? It&rsquo;s great to see that Nil√©ane received a lot of support from within the Mastodon community and many people took this as an opportunity to <a href="https://nileane.fr/@nileane/112778424770956951">donate</a> to various organizations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ü§ß My cold is getting better. I hope that I can finally get back on my bike in the course of next week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ Analogue announced an <a href="https://www.analogue.co/editions/pocket-aluminum">Aluminum Edition</a> of the Pocket. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s unaffordable for me. Additionally, the <a href="https://www.ayntec.com/products/odin2-mini">Odin 2 Mini</a> looks extremely tempting, and the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pocket-evo-world-s-first-7-oled-android-handheld/coming_soon">Ayaneo Pocket EVO</a> with an OLED screen has also been announced ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ Instead, I&rsquo;ve added the <a href="https://scufgaming.com/uk/mobile-controllers/scuf-nomad-black">SCUF Nomad Mobile Gaming Controller</a> to my wishlist. (BTW there&rsquo;s a review at <a href="https://youtu.be/70AF2touZ6k?si=UKf57tlNcCE92a16">Retro Game Corps</a> if you&rsquo;re interested.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üïπÔ∏è I finally played through <a href="https://www.firewatchgame.com">Firewatch</a> and started <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Link-s-Awakening-1514327.html">The Legend of Zelda - Link&rsquo;s Awakening</a> on my Nintendo Switch.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.indieappsales.com/">Indie App Sales!</a> is running again, this time from July 9th to 10th.</p>
<p>The last sale wasn&rsquo;t that long ago, so the list of apps I checked out or bought this time is significantly shorter than my <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/03/12/indieappsales.html">last one</a>. However, this still means that those who didn&rsquo;t make a purchase last time might find something they like this time.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id6499126552">Authenticator App Widget</a> - thinking about buying it; I should delete my <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/3/24191791/twilio-authy-2fa-app-phone-numbers-hack-data-breach">Twilio</a> account and I can still not decide if I should keep my 2FA in iCloud Keychain, hardware token, 1PW or an independent third party app</li>

<li><a href="https://www.fatcatsoftware.com/store">PowerPhotos</a> - I actually use several photo libraries at work, but I think I can probably continue to get by without this app; if I do need it, I just have to pay the full price, which is not that much more expensive than its sale price</li>

			 <p>In continuation of week <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/06/23/what-caught-my.html">25</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh week of 2024:</p>
<p>At the end of the 26th week, I suddenly became ill. It started with a sore throat, followed by headaches, cough, runny nose, and total exhaustion. I am still not completely fit. Covid tests were negative, but I suspect that I caught the summer wave ü§í. Since I spent a lot of time sleeping in bed, I could only evaluate a few things, but I bookmarked a few programs that might be helpful later on.</p>

			 <p>In continuation of week <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/06/17/what-caught-my.html">24</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the twenty-fifth week of 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>üåê The outrage about unethical behavior by big tech companies wanting to make money with AI features continued. See for example: <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ways-you-can-protect-your-website-from-ai-web-crawlers/">How We&rsquo;re Trying to Protect MacStories from AI Bots and Web Crawlers ‚Äì And How You Can, Too</a> or <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/perplexity-plagiarized-our-story-about-how-perplexity-is-a-bullshit-machine/">Perplexity Plagiarized Our Story About How Perplexity Is a Bullshit Machine</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üò† I have a strong opinion about Apple&rsquo;s statement regarding alternative marketplaces during <a href="https://youtu.be/J7al_Gpolb8?si=cAr72MW2ILeFVg4p&amp;t=4064">The Talk Show Live</a> and the latest <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/apple-says-it-wont-ship-major-new-os-features-in-the-eu-this-fall-due-to-dma-uncertainty/">announcements</a> about missing features in the upcoming iOS update in the fall concerning the DMA. I have long considered whether I should write it down in detail. But I&rsquo;d rather save my energy for discussions with my teenage son, behave like an adult, and might simply take the advice to get an Android device as my next phone üòá.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ü§ñ How absolutely freaking cool is this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec_BtS97IR8">I made an AI LEGO¬Æ PixelArt Robot</a>?!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ Speaking of awesome: <a href="https://retrododo.com/doom-x-mario-mod-is-a-game-all-nintendo-fans-need-to-see/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=doom-x-mario-mod-is-a-game-all-nintendo-fans-need-to-see">Doom x Mario Mod</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üíª There are some <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1750125921">Mac games‚Äîavailable at a discount for a limited time.</a>. I bought <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gris/id1465779286?mt=12">‚ÄéGRIS</a>, which is BTW <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/gris">on sale</a> for Steam right now as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéâ Thanks to <a href="https://social.lol/@bendaubney/112661456120973694">Ben</a> and <a href="https://social.lol/@ehqo/112661882960706921">Ehqo</a> and will now look for discounts on games on <a href="https://gg.deals/">Game deals</a> and <a href="https://isthereanydeal.com/">IsThereAnyDeal</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üí∏ Speaking of discounts. Some long-established macOS apps are once again on <a href="https://www.artisanalsoftwarefestival.com/">SummerFest</a> sale. For some of them, I <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/06/14/macos-apps-i.html">wish</a> they were a bit more modern üòé.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ü™ü There is just another free and open-source window manager for macOS that looks promising: <a href="https://github.com/MrKai77/Loop">Loop</a> -  <em>Window management made elegant</em>. Bookmarked just in case I have to switch from <a href="https://rectangleapp.com">Rectangle</a> some day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìà Another app I&rsquo;ve bookmarked in case I need it: <a href="https://process-spy.app/">ProcessSpy - View macOS processes with command line arguments</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìù If you don&rsquo;t want to subscribe to <a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a> to quickly jot down text snippets and move them to other places and also don&rsquo;t really warm up to <a href="https://www.jackcheng.com/bebop/">Bebop</a>, you might want to check out  <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/funnel-quick-capture/id6466168248">‚ÄéFunnel: Quick Capture</a> as recommended by <a href="https://mastodon.social/@thomas_mathoi">Thomas</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üîå I have completely lost track of my USB-C cables. Which ones can only charge, which ones support fast data transfer? So I recently bought two gadgets recommended in the c&rsquo;t<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>: <a href="https://treedix.com">Treedix USB Cable Tester</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and <a href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0CQKC7SPR/?th=1">Gianac USB Adapter</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and now I know that I only have one high-speed USB-A to C cable and only very few USB-C to C cables supporting it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üñ•Ô∏è I have been using my <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/monitors/27-to-31-5-inches/rog-swift-oled-pg32ucdm/">ASUS ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDM</a> monitor for about a week now and I am blown away by its panel. Still don&rsquo;t like the gaming vibe, though but hey, I bought a gaming monitor so nothing to complain about. Was playing <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart/">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a> on my PS5 and enjoy it so far.</p>

			 <p>In continuation of week <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/06/09/what-caught-my.html">23</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the 24th week of 2024.</p>
<p>My eldest son has a guest student from America visiting, who will be staying with us for the next three weeks. Last week was therefore very much about preparation and, after his arrival, a lot of social activities. I really hope, he enjoys his stay with us üòÖ.</p>
<p>I still watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXeOiIDNNek">WWDC keynote</a> and exceptionally listened to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7al_Gpolb8">Talk Show</a>. I will leave the further reporting and commentary to others. Besides that, there was very little I watched this week or that I had a chance to try.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>üîç Somewhere I stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch">fastfetch-cli</a>, which can also be installed via <a href="https://apps.icymi.lol/post/homebrew">Homebrew</a>; a nice tool for the CLI.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>üñºÔ∏è Very beautiful wallpapers: <a href="https://basicappleguy.com/haberdashery/macintoshwallpapers">macOS Sequoia 1984 Macintosh Wallpapers</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì±  A new version of <a href="https://smallcolossus.com/apps/barcodes">Barcodes for iOS</a> was released. I don&rsquo;t carry many plastic cards anymore, but this seems to be a very nice app to digitize them.</p>

<p>üéÆ My wife doesn&rsquo;t like video games being played in the living room, and she also doesn&rsquo;t want to tolerate a bigger TV there<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. On the other hand, my 24&quot; 4K LG monitor for the Mac in my room unfortunately doesn&rsquo;t have an HDMI input, so I could only use the PS5 remotely or when she was already in bed. That should change, and last week I was looking for a monitor that is at least 27&quot; in size, provides 4K, 120 Hz, 90 W USB-C PD Upstream with DP alt., Audio out, at least one HDMI input, and could actually be purchased. The picture quality should also not be terrible. There are shockingly few options. Anyway, it ended up being the <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/monitors/27-to-31-5-inches/rog-swift-oled-pg32ucdm/">ASUS ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDM</a> and I am totally blown away ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£.</p>

			 <p>I wonder how many people don&rsquo;t know that in iOS they can access a multiple selection mode in lists with a double tap and hold, e.g. in Apple Mail, with which they can very easily mark many mails as read, for example. That&rsquo;s only one of so many non-discoverable features in iOS.</p>

			 <p>I am a long-time macOS user and over the decades I&rsquo;ve tried a lot of different apps. Many I have used only briefly or they were discontinued after some time. However, some grow close to my heart, accompany me for countless years, and make my daily life easier. Nevertheless, sometimes some of them eventually lose their shine or fall behind, and I use them just out of habit or nostalgia, even though there are (supposedly) better alternatives.</p>
<p>Currently, there are mainly three programs for me that fall under this category:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink">DevonThink</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.obdev.at/en/products/launchbar/index.html">Launchbar</a></li>
<li><a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink">DevonThink</a> could have become the native macOS version of <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> for me, but with Version 3, I somehow lost access to it. Nowadays, I only use the app, which once shaped my workday, as a storage place for PDFs. That makes me sad.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.obdev.at/en/products/launchbar/index.html">Launchbar</a> hasn&rsquo;t seen any real innovations for a very long time, and more significantly, sometimes it starts with a delay on my Macs, which leads to unwanted keystrokes in other programs. There is a plugin system, but I wish the community was as motivated and diverse as with <a href="https://www.raycast.com">Raycast</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> was such a great password manager. Since the update to Version 8 and the switch to Electron, it no longer feels native, it&rsquo;s sluggish and buggy. The Safari integration<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> has become unusable for me, and I currently keep my passwords in both 1PW and Apple&rsquo;s Keychain. I think with the appearance of Sequoia in the fall, I will probably say goodbye entirely. Even though it will be hard for me.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In continuation of week <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/06/02/what-caught-my.html">22</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the twenty-third week of 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>üîë As the Safari integration of <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> is getting worse and worse - at least for me it is so buggy, that I have disabled the Safari extension and moved my passwords to Apple&rsquo;s Keychain<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> - I am looking for alternatives. I actually don&rsquo;t want to store my passwords only with Apple, either. I feel too locked in there. But using 1PW in parallel with iCloud seems weird to me in the long run. So, I looked around and for the emerging passkey front I ordered a <a href="https://www.token2.com/shop/product/token2-t2f2-pin-dual-release2-fido2-u2f-and-totp-dual-port-nfc-security-key-with-pin-complexity-feature">Token2</a> security key, which arrived this week. According to its description, it &ldquo;combines hardware-based authentication, public-key cryptography, TOTP/HOTP, U2F, and FIDO2 protocols to protect your accounts.&rdquo; To make a long story short, this post-password world is still way too complicated for me. OTP/HOTP, U2F, and FIDO2?! ü§Ø The token stores passkeys but also 2FA codes, and I never know what exactly where and when. Sometimes passkeys alone are enough to log in, sometimes I have to enter an additional 2FA OTP, sometimes - as with Mastodon - the 2FA seems to be the passkey and I still need a username and PW! For the token2 to work, I have to touch it, enter a 6-digit code on my Mac, and then touch it again. That&rsquo;s much more cumbersome than just putting my finger on the touch ID sensor of my Macbook. On my Mac, I can access the stored passkey (but not all or just the OTP tokens, I dont know) on the token2 only very awkwardly but at least via Chrome&rsquo;s settings page. OTP codes can be accessed via the iPhone app but not the passkeys. WTF?! I don&rsquo;t understand anything. In addition, my most important accounts still don&rsquo;t support passkeys. Parallel to this, the <a href="https://protonapps.com">macOS version</a> of <a href="https://proton.me/pass">ProtonPass</a> was released this week, and the <a href="https://account.proton.me/pass/signup?coupon=DPROMO&amp;ref=d-promo-banner&amp;currency=EUR">annual subscription</a> could be purchased for 10 ‚Ç¨. What the heck, I thought, and I purchased it. The Mac app seems, like 1Password, to be an Electron app, and it feels like they just released a web wrapper. It is still far from being a viable alternative. Maybe I have to hope for the rumor mill come true and enjoy Apple&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/apple-standalone-passwords-app/">standalone password manager</a> starting this fall? Anyway, I could not agree more: <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/a-passwordless-future-needs-portability/">A Passwordless Future Needs Portability</a>.</p>

<p>üö® There was a bit of <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/06/05/bartender-alternatives.html">fuss</a> this week about the app Bartender for macOS, which I have highly appreciated so far. I uninstalled it and have been using <a href="https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice">Ice</a> since a couple of days, as <a href="https://apps.icymi.lol/post/ice">mentioned</a>. It works flawlessly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üó∫Ô∏è <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/organic-maps-offline-map/id1567437057?ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Organic Maps: Offline Map on the App Store</a> now also supports iCloud sync.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìö <a href="https://indieapps.space/@sequel/112564001930067974">Sequel</a>, the manager for a variety of media, received a <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/sequel-2-3s-magic-lookup-is-a-perfect-example-of-how-apps-should-integrate-ai/">major update</a>. I am actually very happy with <a href="https://booktrack.app">Booktracks</a>, <a href="https://gamery.app">Gamery</a>, and <a href="https://tvforecastapp.com">TV Forecast</a>, but I started testing the app again. I am not yet sure if there is a place for an additional, more general app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üåê I also tried <a href="https://surfed.app">Surfed</a> again because I actually find the idea of the app very cool. However, it somehow did not reliably record my history and synchronize it between my three used devices. This led to me not finding the things I was looking for, so I will let the subscription expire at the end of the month.</p>

<p>üì∂ <a href="https://www.obdev.at/en/products/littlesnitch/index.html">Little Snitch</a> shows network usage in the menu bar on my work computer.

<p>üçè Apple already announced the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/awards/">2024 winners and finalists - Apple Design Awards</a>. Congrats to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crouton-recipe-manager/id1461650987">‚ÄéCrouton: Recipe Manager on the App¬†Store</a>. (I only wish there was an import feature for <a href="https://mela.recipes">Mela</a>, the app I currently use.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ü§ñ <a href="https://mihobu.lol/2024/06/im-not-anti-ai">I‚Äôm Not Anti-AI</a> spoke to my soul, and since I&rsquo;m already mentioning <a href="https://mihobu.lol/about">Michael</a>, I was very pleased with his mention in the <a href="https://mihobu.lol/junited2024">Junited</a> post ü•∞.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì∏ I <a href="https://toot.cafe/@codepo8/112562828562908837">learned</a> that on macOS, you can open an image with Quick Look by hitting the Space bar and then just select all recognized text (‚åòA) and copy it (‚åòC) to your clipboard ü§Ø.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üß∏ I had to stop collecting <a href="https://brickset.com/sets/ownedby-racemase">LEGO</a> sets due to space constraints and definitely must not buy the <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/06/evercade-alpha-bartop-arcade-system-now-available-for-pre-order">Evercade Alpha Bartop Arcade System</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ However, I couldn&rsquo;t prevent myself from acquiring a Nintendo N64 console. Thanks to <a href="https://kaicolabs.com/product/nintendo-n64-line-doubler-hdmi/">2x Line Doubler</a> and RetroScaler <a href="https://retroreiz.de/shop/nintendo/nintendo-64-n64/zubehoer-nintendo-64/retroscaler-n64-blueretro-wireless-controller-bluetooth-adapter-fuer-nintendo-64/#">N64 BlueRetro</a> Wireless Controller Bluetooth Adapter, I can now play Mario 64 with my <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-64-controller/">Nintendo 64 Bluetooth Controller</a>.

<p>üîã If you don&rsquo;t trust macOS&rsquo;s built-in battery management, don&rsquo;t use <a href="https://apphousekitchen.com">AlDente</a>, and are looking for another application of this kind, you might want to check out <a href="https://micropixels.software/apps/batfi">BatFi ‚Äì maximize your Mac&rsquo;s battery lifespan</a>. BTW I have decided that the built-in function must suffice for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üîã Same topic, different area: <a href="https://lihaoyun6.github.io/airbattery/">AirBattery</a> - <em>Get the battery usage of all your devices at once!</em> I noted it down in case <a href="https://v2.airbuddy.app">AirBuddy</a> stops working someday.</p>

<p>üíª <a href="https://commandline.johnnydecimal.com">Johnny Decimal</a> brings Ellane the command line of macOS. If you want to dive deeper afterward, I can definitely recommend <a href="https://www.takecontrolbooks.com/command-line/">Take Control of the Mac Command Line with Terminal</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üõ†Ô∏è I had planned <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/02/03/what-caught-my.html">months ago</a> to finally dive into to the <a href="https://gridfinity.xyz/">Gridfinity</a> system. Somehow, I never had the time to pick out the right base plates. Thanks to the &ldquo;reminder&rdquo; from <a href="https://digitalcourage.social/@mjaschen/112552631190246734">Marcus</a> and the hint about these <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/170956-basic-gridfinity-baseplates-cadquery-customizable">baseplates</a>, I just started with one desk drawer. I already knew it, but oh, how awesome is that! I definitely won&rsquo;t get out of this rabbit hole anytime soon. BTW thanks to <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/481168">Gridfinity Extended</a>, you can easily click together all sorts of things with <a href="https://seasick.github.io/openscad-web-gui/?https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fostat%2Fgridfinity_extended_openscad%2Fmain%2Fcombined%2Fgridfinity_basic_cup.scad">OpenSCAD</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéôÔ∏è <a href="https://www.macstories.net/podcasts/">MacStories</a> has added two new podcasts to its family. The pilot episodes were entertaining. However, based on their teasers, I honestly expected a little more than using the Reminders backend in Fantastical or playing games on the iPad with a controller to get the hosts out of their <a href="https://www.macstories.net/comfort-zone/">Comfort Zone</a> üòà.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üó£Ô∏è German-speaking readers should try the <a href="https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/dialekt-test-wir-wissen-woher-sie-stammen-jetzt-noch-genauer-205060715129">dialect test</a> from the Swiss Tages-Anzeiger, which has made its rounds on the web. I&rsquo;m still unsure how they fake it, but the precision of the results is amazing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üá™üá∫ This weekend are European elections. Go vote! (And vote for a democratic party!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üçè Next week is the WWDC. It will not be a bug fix year once again. I hope so much that Apple can resist the urge to integrate pointless AI functions into every little app. (I just want a PDF reader that doesn&rsquo;t mess up my annotations and a more stable system in general üò¢.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I&rsquo;ve received my fist feedback email to a blog post I wrote. Friendly shout-out to <a href="https://darren.me">Darren</a>!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üòÆ Apart from that, this week in my filter bubble I learnt once again that we are all just people with feelings and that they can be hurt very quickly. I hope that the apologies were sincere and, above all, that they are accepted. Being able to forgive is also a very important trait in a tolerant community.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a great week! üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.macbartender.com/Bartender5/">Bartender</a> was acquired and neither the original programmer nor the new owner informed about it. Since the app requires extensive permissions to perform its service, including screen recording, and the communication about the sale apparently went rather catastrophically<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, many <a href="https://isfeeling.social/@matt/112560795817973480">users</a> are somehow concerned and are looking for an alternative.

			 <p>In continuation of week <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/05/26/what-caught-my.html">21</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the 22. week of 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è This week was relatively quiet in terms of tech-related news, partly because my wife had a bicycle accident in the middle of the week. I have borrowed a car, transported her 100 km from one hospital to the local one, she had surgery, and now she is hopefully recovering quickly at home and will soon be back on her feet (and back on the bike).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üå¶Ô∏è <a href="https://mastodon.social/@CARROT/112524771010511872">CARROT Weather</a> has been released in version 6.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üíª The trick on how to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/05/24/get-chatgpt-for-mac-skip-waitlist/">Get ChatGPT for Mac and skip the waitlist</a> actually works seamlessly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚èØÔ∏è This week, I repeatedly<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> came across <a href="https://iina.io/">IINA - the modern media player for macOS</a> - which I amusingly already had in my bookmarks collection but hadn&rsquo;t looked at yet. While I was at it, I finally connected <a href="https://eternalstorms.at/transloader/">Transloader</a> with <a href="https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/">Downie</a>. BTW: <a href="https://papertube.live/">Papertube</a> - <em>Turn any YouTube podcast, TED Talk, or chat into easy-to-read text with real speaker names:</em> I need to take a closer look at it when I get the chance. And while I&rsquo;m at it, <a href="https://cobalt.tools/">cobalt</a> also looks like an interesting service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìù <a href="https://wandzeitung.xyz/@pixelgraphix/112513549637333081">pixelgraphix</a> pointed out <a href="https://www.jackcheng.com/bebop-design-dev-process/">Bebop</a>. If <a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a> is an overkill (or maybe too expensive) for you, you might be able to quickly and easily push texts to Obsidian with this really nice app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìÖ I use <a href="https://sindresorhus.com/dato">Dato</a>, but if you&rsquo;re only interested in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/week-number/id6502579523?mt=12">Week Number</a> in the menu bar, you can install the app of the same name from the same <a href="https://sindresorhus.com/apps">developer</a> for free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì± I completely overlooked that there is now a sister application for iOS for <a href="https://bombich.com/ccc-mobile-backup">Carbon Copy Cloner</a>. I need to check it out when I get the chance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üé• <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/kino-pro-video-camera/id6472380172">‚ÄéKino - Pro Video Camera</a> from the makers of <a href="https://halide.cam">Halide</a> has been released. It also looks very promising.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ In a quiet moment, I need to take a closer look at this: <a href="https://steamdeckhq.com/another-majoras-mask-pc-port-on-steam-deck/">Another Majora&rsquo;s Mask PC Port Is Here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ I wasn&rsquo;t aware until now that you can even run <a href="https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SteamOS-Waydroid-Installer">Android</a> on the Steam Deck. I&rsquo;ll keep that in mind until I figure out what I would actually use it for üòé.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üíª Recently, I wanted to find out what a specific setting is called in English in macOS System Settings, so I set up a virtual macOS installation with <a href="https://mac.getutm.app/">UTM - Virtual machines for Mac</a>. Wow, that was easy. (Unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t manage to access external USB devices/hard drives yet.) Next, I should get into Docker&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ This week, after more than two months, my &ldquo;repaired,&rdquo; i.e., replaced Playdate arrived. It&rsquo;s now the third one. Maybe this one will last a bit longer ü§û.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ I also acquired an old Nintendo N64 console. The picture quality of PAL games on the PAL version of the console is abysmally bad on my LG LED TV. Interestingly, NTSC games, started from the <a href="https://krikzz.com/our-products/cartridges/ed64x5.html">Everdrive</a>, look good ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üåê I was happy to hear from <a href="https://lubieniebieski.pl/bullets/15/">Adam</a> again.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a great week and take care üòá</p>

			 <p>TIL that the number of a CR battery <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Button_cell">indicates its diameter and thickness</a>. For example, CR2032 is 20 mm wide and 3.2 mm thick.</p>

			 <p>In the whole Pro discussion about the iPad, I always miss the decisive factor for me: There is no multi-user support. I&rsquo;m not going to spend ‚Ç¨2000 on an ultra-modern device that only one person in the household can use, whereas a Macbook Air is available to the whole family for a very similar price.</p>

			 <p>In continuation of week <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/05/20/what-caught-my.html">20</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the 21. week of 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>‚å®Ô∏è In <a href="https://esamecar.weblog.lol/2023/09/what-caught-my-attention-in-week-thirty-seven-2023">week 37 of 2023</a> I bought a <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k1-se-wireless-mechanical-keyboard?variant=39652024713305">Keychron K1 SE Wireless Mechanical Keyboard</a> and have been trying to learn to type on the keyboard since then. My error rate was extremely high, and I found it exhausting to have to lift my fingers significantly higher than I am used to with other keyboards. I actually really like the keyboard, but this week I finally pulled the plug and bought a <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/mx-keys-mac-wireless-keyboard.920-009552.html">Logitech MX Keys for Mac</a>. I should have done this six months ago. I get along with it unbelievably better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì± And in <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/01/07/what-caught-my.html">week 01</a> I was tempted to order a Clicks Keyboard for my iPhone. <a href="https://microblog.pratikmhatre.com/2024/05/20/review-clicks-keyboard.html">Glad I did not do this</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üíª Speaking of devices I find interesting but won&rsquo;t buy: <a href="https://daylightcomputer.com/">Daylight - A More Caring Computer</a>. If there was just an affordable Android-based e-ink reader I could use <a href="https://readwise.io/read">Readwise Reader</a> on. (570 ‚Ç¨ for an <a href="https://pocketbook.de/de_en/pocketbook-inkpad-eo-mist-grey">PocketBook InkPad Eo</a> is too much.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üîç <a href="https://512pixels.net/2024/05/udm14/">&amp;udm=14</a> is the suffix you want to use for Google searches. This AI stuff is really <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-is-paying-reddit-60-million-for-fucksmith-to-tell-its-users-to-eat-glue/">getting bananas</a> and <a href="https://www.threads.net/@crumbler/post/C7VGpYSPOgT">completely</a> <a href="https://mastodon.social/@JoeUchill/112493317168967705">out of control</a> it <a href="https://mastodon.social/@niclake/112496938801436276">seems</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì¶ I am waiting now for almost two months for Panic to ship a replacement for my broken <a href="https://play.date">playdate</a>. It seems the first package was lost and maybe I&rsquo;ll receive the next one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ Fortunately, this parcel did not get lost and I have I received my <a href="https://www.epilogue.co/product/gb-operator">GB Operator</a> and went through my ROMs collection. I was irritated to find out that my &ldquo;Super Mario Advance 4&rdquo; is on a rewritable unofficial ROM cartridge. It cost about $20 and looks absolutely genuine to me. Why do people go to so much trouble to fake these not-so-rare and not-so-expensive cartridges?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üé® <a href="https://mastodon.social/@seanfletchr">Sean Fletcher</a> is currently working on another <a href="https://faq.deltaemulator.com/getting-started/how-to-install-delta">Delta</a> Skin, this time for the NDS: <a href="https://seanfletchr.gumroad.com/l/delta-duo">Delta Duo (Preview)</a>. I really like it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì± And if someone has lost track of all the iOS emulators, the <a href="https://retrododo.com/beginners-guide-to-iphone-ipad-and-apple-tv-emulators/">Beginner&rsquo;s Guide To iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV Emulators</a> might help, and for newcomers to Retroarch, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHlJ3zANcjo">iPhone &amp; iPad Starter Guide on YouTube</a> could be helpful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üé¨ <a href="https://mastodontech.de/@andrekaiser/112500666826531181">Andre</a> mentioned <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/switch-tv-on/id6474692732">‚ÄéSwitch TV ON</a> - <em>TV shows and movies in detail</em>. It seems to be a great source for finding information about shows, actors, etc. Like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/callsheet-find-cast-crew/id1672356376?platform=iphone">Callsheet</a> but without a subscription.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚è≤Ô∏è If you are looking for a simple and free focus / Pomodoro timer, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/breaks-focus-timer/id6450434996">‚ÄéBreaks: Focus Timer</a> might be the right iOS app for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üîí <a href="https://obdev.at/en/products/littlesnitch/index.html">Little Snitch ‚Äî Network Monitor and Application Firewall for macOS</a> has been upgraded to version 6.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nice set of rules from <a href="https://louplummer.lol/post/my-rules-for-me">Lou</a> and <a href="https://marginalia.micro.blog/2024/05/24/and-the-rules.html">Alexandra</a>. I would say that you absolutely can&rsquo;t go wrong with it in your life.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a nice week! üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

			 <p>In continuation of week <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/05/05/what-caught-my.html">18</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the 19. - 20. week of 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I was cycling with my wife for a few days along the former East-West German border. The weather was fantastic, the inclines were not to be underestimated but manageable. A bit of a shame, but we tried to take it with humour: Once again, we had to realize that the concept of Deutsche Bahn has unfortunately totally failed. Train travel is an absolute disaster in our country, and that makes me very sad and angry at the FDP (the party that provides our transport minister). But that&rsquo;s a topic for another time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìµ During the bike tour, I decided to take a one or two-week break from social media. I deleted my Mastodon clients from my devices (I already don&rsquo;t use Threads, Instagram, X, Facebook, etc.) and also avoided YouTube. I still read a few posts in my RSS reader, though. So, do I feel better now? I don&rsquo;t think so, but it was good anyways, I think.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What else was interesting to me?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è <a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/05/hammerhead-new-karoo-3-review-upgrade.html">Hammerhead Karoo 3 In-Depth Review: Worth the Upgrade?</a>: there&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.eu.hammerhead.io/products/karoo">successor</a> to my current bike computer. Since my two biggest criticisms, battery life and responsiveness, have obviously not been addressed, I am not in danger of wanting to spend the 500 ‚Ç¨ (!) for it for now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/retroarch/id6499539433">‚ÄéRetroArch</a> has been released for iOS and similar platforms. For those who aren&rsquo;t totally into retro gaming, dedicated emulators like <a href="https://faq.deltaemulator.com">Delta</a>, <a href="https://www.ppsspp.org">PPSPPP</a> are probably the much more convenient way to enjoy some old games. Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s wonderful to see that RetroArch now runs on the iPhone and especially on the AppleTV! (I use a dedicated Raspberry Pi with <a href="https://batocera.org">Batocera</a> or my An<a href="https://www.analogue.co/pocket">alogue Pocket</a> with its dock for the TV, though.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìë <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/pdf-squeezer/id6478766883">‚ÄéPDF Squeezer</a> is now also available for iOS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üíæ <a href="https://bombich.com/">Carbon Copy Cloner</a> has been released in version 7, and I took the opportunity to support the developer by purchasing the upgrade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üñºÔ∏è If you have an old, currently unused iPad lying around (I&rsquo;ve heard there are new ones üòá), you might want to check out <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/synced-photo-frame-by-re-frame/id1667679282">Synced Photo Frame by Re-Frame</a> and repurpose it as a digital photo frame.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üñºÔ∏è <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/photo-tape-connect-images/id1637682813">Photo Tape</a> - <em>Connect Images</em>: the app looks like a pretty neat way to simply merge images.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üîñ <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/plinky-easily-save-links/id1597187737">Plinky</a> - <em>Easily Save Links</em>: there&rsquo;s another bookmark manager. I just bought the lifetime license for <a href="https://anybox.app">Anybox</a> and therefore my search (for now) is over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚è≥ <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/time-ring/id6479212418">‚ÄéTime - Ring</a> - the elegant and fun way to count down to your most anticipated events! For those interested who haven&rsquo;t yet paid for <a href="https://pinning.app">Pinning</a>, <a href="https://upaheadapp.com">Up Ahead</a> (which has <a href="https://indieapps.space/@upahead/112456859633684855">resumed development</a>), <a href="https://countdowns-app.com">Countdowns</a>, or one of the many other apps and are looking for a simple, free option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ I installed <a href="https://streetpea.github.io/chiaki4deck/">chiaki4deck</a> on my <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/">Steam Deck</a> and can now effortlessly do <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/remote-play/">PS5 Remote Play</a>. However, I fear that someone might empty half the PSN Store with my account, but certain risks have to be taken üò¨</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ Due to the early access release of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/">Hades II</a>, the <a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/">first one</a> was very cheap, so I bought it for the Steam Deck and started playing it. Actually, I wanted to keep my hands off these rogue-like games, but it&rsquo;s just too good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üåû Have a great week!</p>

			 <p>In continuation of week <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/04/28/what-caught-my.html">17</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the 18. week of 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>üöÄ <a href="https://norden.social/@czottmann/112382917610810130">Carlo</a> just released a beta of <a href="https://actions.work/ui-actions">UI Actions</a>. It follows his awesome <a href="https://apps.icymi.lol/post/actions-for-obsidian">Actions for Obsidian</a>, but with this you can script macOS apps that lack native shortcut integration. Definitely an app to keep an eye on, as an addition or alternative to <a href="https://apps.icymi.lol/post/keyboard-maestro">Keyboard Maestro</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üïπÔ∏è It seems like every week a handful of new retro handhelds hit the market. Whether interest will wane due to <a href="https://faq.deltaemulator.com">Delta</a>, I don&rsquo;t know, but for those like me who have long lost track of all the different devices, take a look at <a href="https://joeysretrohandhelds.com/handheld-list/">Handheld List</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üê∞ Following the <a href="https://humane.com">humane AI pin</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24132139/humane-ai-pin-launch-review">disaster</a>, the second AI gadget, <a href="https://www.rabbit.tech">rabbit R1</a>, doesn&rsquo;t fare much better: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddTV12hErTc">Rabbit R1: Barely Reviewable</a>. But at least it&rsquo;s orange, costs only a fraction of its sibbling, and looks totally cute on a shelf next to a <a href="https://play.date">playdate</a> console. Speaking of which, in <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/03/25/what-caught-my.html">week 12</a> the crank handle of mine broke, I sent it in for repair, and now the replacement device has been waiting somewhere in America to be shipped for over 4 weeks üò¢. I&rsquo;m curious to see if I will ever see my playdate again ü§û.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì¶ On <a href="https://bento3d.design/">Bento3D</a> you can easily click together boxes for your 3D printer according to your needs and download the corresponding .stl files. I wish it were compatible with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra_9zU-mnl8">Gridfinity</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚å®Ô∏è I am a long-time <a href="https://apps.icymi.lol/post/typinator">Typinator</a> user and there are a bunch of other alternatives for text expansion, but someone<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> mentioned <a href="https://espanso.org/">Espanso</a>. So, this might be worth checking out if you&rsquo;re still on the hunt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üñ±Ô∏è As previously mentioned, I own a <a href="https://ergonis.com/keycue/download">KeyCue</a> license, which I don&rsquo;t really utilize, but a nice feature is its ability to add your own shortcuts to menu entries. If you only want to use this feature and have so far not employed the cumbersome method of doing it via the Settings app, you might want to take a look at the free app <a href="https://www.houdah.com/customShortcuts/">CustomShortcuts ‚Äì Customize menu keyboard shortcuts</a>.</p>
</li>

<p>‚åö For months, the capacity display of my Apple Watch S7 stood at exactly 80%. Apple replaces the battery for free if it drops to 79% and you are paying for Apple Care. I was about to file a class-action lawsuit because I was sure the value would never drop to 79% üòá. However, this week it finally happened and my watch was replaced. It&rsquo;s great not to risk the watch refusing to work in the afternoon. I think this also means I can get by with my current model for another year and not be in a bind wanting a new one in the fall. What I found interesting was that despite a backup, not all settings were transferred to the new one. So, I had to search in vain in the Watch app on my phone and then in the settings directly on the watch for where to set that a simple swipe on the watch face switches to another. I couldn&rsquo;t find it and had to consult the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/change-apple-watch-faces-with-a-swipe/">internet</a>. I&rsquo;ve had better experiences with Apple&rsquo;s UI in the past I must say. A few other little things were also not set correctly. It&rsquo;s as if an intern at Apple had quit, and now the latest settings are no longer included in the backup routine ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ I had actually forbidden myself from buying games for other platforms if I already own them for one. Well, buying <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/">Hades</a> for less than 9 EUR for the Steam Deck, even though I already have the PS5 version, was definitely the last exception ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Luckily, Nintendo stubbornly prevents me from logging into their eShop with my mobile phone (despite the disabled ad blocker and paused pi hole), so at least I&rsquo;m not in danger of acquiring the Switch version as well.</p>

<p>üìö I wish it wouldn&rsquo;t cost 300 ‚Ç¨ to have <a href="https://readwise.io/read">Reader</a> running on an <a href="https://euroshop.boox.com/products/boox-palma">E-Ink Android</a> device.</p>

<li>
<p>üíæ The small 88x31 icons in the website footer are enjoying great popularity again. BTW those by <a href="https://ko-fi.com/s/798b83fbcc">Andy</a> are awesome. If you want to take a look at the originals from GeoCities, you&rsquo;ll find them here: <a href="https://hellnet.work/8831/">THE 88√ó31 ARCHIVE</a>.</p>

<p>üéÆ I don&rsquo;t own a Nintendo 64 console, but I&rsquo;ve already ordered an <a href="https://krikzz.com/our-products/cartridges/ed64x5.html">EVERDRIVE-64 X5</a> just in case ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>

			 <p>In continuation of week <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/04/21/what-caught-my.html">16</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the seventeenth week of 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>üñ±Ô∏è <a href="https://512pixels.net/2024/04/ai-overlay-tmp-home-folder-mac-os/">Logitech‚Äôs Mouse Software Now Includes ChatGPT Support, Adds Janky ‚Äòai_overlay_tmp‚Äô Directory to Users‚Äô Home Folders</a>: It seems to be a good time to reconsider using <a href="https://plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/index.html">SteerMouse</a> or <a href="https://better-mouse.com/">BetterMouse ‚Äì Comprehensive mouse utility for macOS</a> instead. In addition, lots of people seem to like <a href="https://macmousefix.com/">Mac Mouse Fix</a>. Guess, I have to evaluate &ldquo;mouse drivers&rdquo; now ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ The enthusiasm for retro gaming continues to hold on. Delta received its first update in the AltStore PAL (installation went absolutely smoothly) and a <a href="https://mastodon.social/@rileytestut/112344968893166844">native iPad version</a> has been announced for non-Europeans. Moreover, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@seanfletchr/112316140524281749">Sean Fletcher</a> has released absolutely great skins for Deltas GBC und GBA cores.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üñ•Ô∏è macOS can also be beautified, as <a href="https://pdx.social/@louie">Louie Mantia, Jr.</a> has updated his beautiful <a href="https://lmnt.me/blog/icons/ive-drives-vol-3.html">Time Machine icons</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@harshil/112336437696902565#.">Harshil Shah</a> for bringing this to my attention.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ And for all those who have now rediscovered their love for Pokemon thanks to Delta, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@BenRiceM/112332217934897288#.">BenRiceM</a> has released the appropriate app: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6477297968?pt=96658924&amp;ct=Mastodon&amp;mt=8">Ketchup for Pok√©mon</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìù As you might know, I switched from Apple Notes to <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> as my main notes app some time ago, but those who still use Apple Notes as their <a href="https://defaults.rknight.me">App Defaults</a> now have in addition to <a href="https://smallest.app/notesollama/">NotesOllama</a> another extensions available, <a href="https://www.pronotes.app/">ProNotes</a>, which hopefully further improves working with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìä Speaking of <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, for those still looking for new plugins, the current episode of AppStories <a href="https://appstories.net/episodes/380">Obsidian Setup Check-In</a> and the blog post <a href="https://amerpie.lol/2024/04/24/lesser-known-but.html">10 Lesser Known But Super Useful Obsidian Plugins</a> by <a href="https://social.lol/@amerpie">Lou Plummer</a> might be worth checking out.

</li>
<li>
<p>‚å®Ô∏è I own a <a href="https://ergonis.com/keycue">KeyCue</a> license and use the app less than I thought I would. The app is not exactly cheap, but fortunately, there are a number of alternatives for those interested, including <a href="https://sergii.tatarenkov.name/keyclu/support/">KeyClu</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è <a href="https://mastodon.ie/@donovanh/112331598617823066#.">Donovan</a> has released a free <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ie/app/reps-bodyweight-exercises/id6477761819">Bodyweight exercises</a> tracker for iOS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üçè <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/26/signed-out-of-apple-id-account-problem-password/">Apple users are being locked out of their Apple IDs with no explanation</a> - fortunately, I have not been affected so far.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üïπÔ∏è I also played a lot of <a href="https://deadcells.com">Dead Cells</a> on the <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/oled">Steam Deck OLED</a> this week but couldn&rsquo;t get past the penultimate level. I also briefly looked at <a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/">Hades</a> on the PS5. It looks very nice, but I need to play something other than RogueLi[kt]e games before I dive into this. I really long to be able to load a game save to progress in a game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìö I know I definitely shouldn&rsquo;t do it, but I&rsquo;m thinking about whether or not I should spend 150 ‚Ç¨ on a <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/the-force-of-creativity-5008878">book</a> ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üé¨ Watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27165281/">Sterben</a>, a German movie, in the cinema - very intense 3 hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ü§í I&rsquo;ve been sick with a cold for two weeks now and feel unable to exercise and in general struggling through the day. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to hopefully getting over this next week.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Wishing you a beautiful week! ‚òÄÔ∏è</p>

			 <p>In continuation of week <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/04/15/what-caught-my.html">15</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the sixteenth week of 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>üéÆ This week was an exciting one for retro gaming on iOS. After some initial debacle with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/15/apple-removes-igba-from-app-store/">ripoff GB emulator</a>, which was pulled after a few days by Apple, another one, Bimmy, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/16/24132351/iphone-apple-app-store-nes-emulator-bimmy-removed">was pulled</a> by its developer just a day after it was approved. But then the well-known <a href="https://faq.deltaemulator.com">Delta</a> emulator developed by <a href="https://mastodon.social/@rileytestut">Riley Testut</a>, which was previously only available via the <a href="https://altstore.io/">AltStore</a> was <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@altstore/112287558511134794">released worldwide</a> in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688">App Store</a>, except for Europe. Here you can get it exclusively via the AltStore PAL, an alternate iOS Appstore.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Its developer wrote a little about the <a href="https://mastodon.social/@rileytestut/112299267044864020">availability of Delta</a> and the <a href="https://rileytestut.com/blog/2024/04/17/introducing-altstore-pal/">AltStore PAL</a> in general. Installing the AltStore and downloading Delta went as smoothly as Apple currently allows, and the app is just great. Very nicely designed, customizable through <a href="https://skins4delta.com/">skins</a> and comprehensive. However, I see myself rather less playing GB[AC]* games on my iPhone, as they bring more fun on the <a href="https://www.analogue.co/pocket">Analogue Pocket</a> or one of my other devices with a built-in gamepad. However, the situation is similar to photography, you know, the best camera is the one you have with you &hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üïπÔ∏è If you&rsquo;ve now gotten a taste for it and also want to play some of your legally acquired <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/how-to-load-your-game-boy-games-onto-the-iphone-to-play-in-the-delta-emulator/">Roms</a> on your Mac but don&rsquo;t want to install an all-in-one solution like <a href="https://www.retroarch.com/?page=platforms">RetroArch</a> or even <a href="https://es-de.org">ES-DE</a> right away, you can also pick up some tips on stand-alone emulators here: <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/emulators-arent-new-heres-the-great-ones-on-the-mac/">Emulators aren‚Äôt new; here‚Äôs the great ones on the Mac</a>.
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/19/ps1-gamecube-wii-emulator-coming-to-app-store/">More emulators</a> are also apparently in the starting blocks, and I also downloaded a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/emu64-xl/id6483251916">C64 emulator</a>, but I haven&rsquo;t looked at it yet and therefore don&rsquo;t know if this a valid recommendation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üß† This week, <a href="https://www.meta.ai/">MetaAI</a> unveiled its new Llama 3 models, which can be easily downloaded to the Mac using <a href="https://ollama.com">Ollama</a> with commands such as <code>ollama pull llama3:8b</code> or <code>ollama pull llama3:70b</code>. If you prefer not to use the command line to interact with the LLM or any of the GUIs mentioned in <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/02/25/what-caught-my.html">Week 8</a>, you might consider exploring <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/enchanted-llm/id6474268307">‚ÄéEnchanted LLM</a>. This app offers a free and slick interface to interact with Ollama&rsquo;s LLMs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üíª I mainly use <a href="https://rectangleapp.com/pro">Rectangle Pro</a> for window management on macOS, which also offers the possibility to throw windows into predefined areas via mouse gestures (<em>Window Throw</em>), but if you are looking for an alternative, you might want to check out the free <a href="https://github.com/MrKai77/Loop">Loop</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ü§ñ This is so f*%king incredible: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9EM5_VFlt8">Farewell to HD Atlas</a>. But of course that can still be topped: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29ECwExc-_M">All New Atlas</a> ü§Ø.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ü¶â As already mentioned on my little <a href="https://apps.icymi.lol/post/dropscout">Site Project</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/dropscout/id6477324347">DropScout</a> for iOS / iPad is out of beta and available for free: <em>DropScout tracks your Amazon products and alerts you when prices drop!</em> Also mentioned there, since version 3.11, <a href="https://soulver.app">Soulver</a> once again includes an iOS version that can be unlocked with a one-time purchase. After years of incompatibility, you can finally exchange files between macOS and iOS again. Did I mention before, that I love Soulver?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üíª Lou blogged about apps that <a href="https://amerpie.lol/2024/04/15/open-at-login.html">Open at Login</a> on his Mac, and two apps were new to me. As <a href="https://www.fadel.io/missioncontrolplus">Mission Control Plus</a> - <em>Put the &ldquo;control&rdquo; back in Mission Control</em> - is included in my Setapp subscription, I started evaluating it. The app does mainly two things, it adds an X-button to Mission Control&rsquo;s windows and several keybard shortcuts managing them. The other one was <a href="https://github.com/nielsmouthaan/backup-status?tab=readme-ov-file">Backup Status</a> - <em>View the status of Time Machine right from your desktop or Notification Center</em>. Bookmarked but not tried myself yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üíª On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/abettercomputer">A Better Computer</a>, I stumbled across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHrMLowLpDY">10 useful Mac apps you may not have heard of</a> and found <a href="https://www.cleftnotes.com">Cleft</a> quite interesting. However, it absolutely did not want to work for me and instead of transcribing my spoken text, it bombarded me with error messages and just deleted everything. Well, I might look at it again in version 1.1 or maybe 2.x.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üõ†Ô∏è Whether I spend a lot of time troubleshooting to get something running that I would like to accomplish depends strongly on the platform I&rsquo;m doing it on and my expectations of the project/product.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> With Apple products or other commercial services, my tolerance for having to spend a lot of time to make something work as it should is quite low, for example. This was also one of the reasons why I switched from Windows to macOS about 20 years ago. I just didn&rsquo;t feel like dealing with the fiddling anymore. With Linux projects, it&rsquo;s different for me. I almost expect it to be difficult, and it&rsquo;s fine with me because in general it&rsquo;s open source and I heavily benefit from the hard work from others. So, I spent countless hours trying to set up a WLAN access point on a Raspi that is connected to my network via LAN and brings the connected devices into the network via VPN. (My regular router can&rsquo;t do this, and I have one or two devices that I&rsquo;d like to connect to the network via VPN, but I can&rsquo;t install a client on them.) I ultimately failed and gave up a few weeks ago. Last week, I stumbled across the <a href="https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-mt3000/">BerylAX GL-MT3000</a> and it took me no more than 5 minutes to get it up and running with <a href="https://nordvpn.com/">NordVPN</a>. This really blew me away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚è∫Ô∏è The <a href="https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/stream-deck-neo">Stream Deck Neo</a> was announced and looks really compelling to me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì∫ Continued watching <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/palm-royale/seasons/1/episodes/1">Palm Royale</a> - still not sure about this TV series.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üé• Watch <a href="https://trakt.tv/movies/riders-of-justice-2020">Riders of Justice</a> - enjoyed that one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üïπÔ∏è Spent way too much money for discounted games on Steam and played a lot of <a href="https://deadcells.com">Dead Cells</a>. Really hard but I like it a lot.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>

<p>BTW I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Apple&rsquo;s spontaneous change of direction regarding emulators was related to the AltStore PAL to take some wind out of the sails of the alternative app store, but maybe I&rsquo;m going too far with that. Perhaps others can unravel this.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			 <p>In continuation of week <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/04/07/what-caught-my.html">14</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the 15. week of 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>üéÆ I was briefly excited when I read that the first GBA emulator had landed in the iOS App Store. Unfortunately, it was not a legitimate app, and it was subsequently removed (again too late and why at all approved?) from the store: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/15/apple-removes-igba-from-app-store/">Apple Removes Game Boy Emulator iGBA From App Store Due to Spam and Copyright Violations - MacRumors</a>.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>üèéÔ∏è I&rsquo;ve learned that in Mario Kart 8, you can choose from 703,560 driver, kart body, tires, and glider combinations, but you can still be more clever than others: <a href="https://www.mayerowitz.io/blog/mario-meets-pareto">Mario meets Pareto</a> ü§Ø.</p>

<p>üì± At first, I was skeptical, but <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/simple-scan-quick-scanner/id6477965455">Simple Scan ‚Ä¢ Quick Scanner</a> gets updated regularly and has reached a stage where it is definitely much more useful than a simple one-step shortcut or going into the Files app and initiating the scan from within there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üíª I am a long-time <a href="https://www.macbartender.com/">Bartender 5</a> user and don&rsquo;t see a reason to switch. However, for those who don&rsquo;t already have a <a href="https://setapp.com/apps/bartender">Setapp</a> subscription or don&rsquo;t want to pay that much money for a &ldquo;simple&rdquo; utility app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/ibar-menubar-icon-control-tool/id6443843900?mt=12">‚ÄéiBar-Menubar icon control tool</a> might be worth a look. However, you have to more or less blindly trust the developers, as their website will probably remain incomprehensible to many people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üõë If it also bothers you that every App Store link in Safari directly opens the store instead of just calling up the overview page, maybe this will help: <a href="https://github.com/lapcat/StopTheMacAppStore">StopTheMacAppStore</a> - <em>Mac app that stops Safari from automatically opening the App Store app</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üñ•Ô∏è I used to have a version of <a href="https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/">iStat Menus</a> (<a href="https://setapp.com/apps/istat-menus">Setapp</a>) running on every Mac, but nowadays I do without. However, there is also a number of alternatives, for example, the freshly updated <a href="https://usage.pro/">Usage</a>, which, for instance, also allows access to the status of the Mac from a mobile device, or the free <a href="https://github.com/exelban/stats">Stats</a> - <em>macOS system monitor in your menu bar.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìÅ In <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/03/03/what-caught-my.html">week 9</a>, I mentioned <a href="https://github.com/neilsardesai/Manila">Manila</a>, a free app that lets you change the color of a folder&rsquo;s icon. There seems to be a similar paid upfront app called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/foldery/id815333099">Foldery</a>, that might be easier to set up and is regularly updated; bookmarked for the case that Manila stops working someday. If just a color is not enough, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/folderizer/id6480047256?mt=12">‚ÄéFolderizer</a> might be worth a try, too. So far, I was occasionally using the <a href="https://setapp.com/apps/image2icon">Setapp</a> version of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/image2icon-make-your-icons/id992115977?mt=12&amp;ls=1">Image2icon</a> but might give the former a shot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ I fell in love with <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/gamery-game-tracker/id1607763458">‚ÄéGamery - Game Tracker</a> and switched to the app from <a href="https://gametrack.app">GameTrack</a>. Actually, I was looking for an app that runs both on iOS and macOS, but I am not very satisfied with the macOS version of GameTrack. The developer of Gamery has mentioned that he plans to enable the iPadOS version on macOS and is working on a native macOS version, too. That all sounds very good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üóìÔ∏è Sindre Sorhus makes so many great apps, and many of his programs are free. To support him, I bought the Mac App Store version of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/dato/id1470584107?mt=12">Dato</a> even though it was available via <a href="https://setapp.com/apps/dato">Setapp</a>, too. Anyways, if you&rsquo;re looking for a free alternative, <a href="https://www.mowglii.com/itsycal/">Itsycal for Mac</a> or <a href="https://github.com/pakerwreah/Calendr">Calendrx</a> might be worth a try.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì∏ I briefly looked into the new app from Aptonic, the developers of <a href="https://aptonic.com">Dropzone</a> (<a href="https://setapp.com/apps/dropzone">Setapp</a>), called <a href="https://screensnap.ai/">ScreenSnapAI</a> - <em>AI Powered Screenshot Manager</em>. But that&rsquo;s not for me. I will definitely stick with <a href="https://cleanshot.com">CleanShot X</a> (<a href="https://setapp.com/apps/cleanshot">Setapp</a>) for the time being. By the way, did you know that pressing space to switch to window capture from capture area mode also works with CleanShot X and not only with the built-in macOS tool?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üåê The one and only master of the indie web, <a href="https://social.lol/@robb">Robb</a>, released <a href="https://echofeed.app/">EchoFeed</a>. You have most probably already heard of his service to pipe an RSS feed to open web endpoints, like Mastodon or Micro.blog, etc. Love it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì≤ Did you know that you can change the iOS wheel picker to a <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sandropennisi/112268681870145361">number pad</a> by just clicking on it? I did not!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üåç <a href="https://digitalcourage.social/@mjaschen/112264822932312746">Marcus reminded me</a> that it is a very good idea to support OpenStreetMap. I am now an associated member.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì∫ Watched the Pilot of <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/palm-royale/seasons/1/episodes/1">Palm Royale</a> with my wife. Not yet sure what it will turn into.</p>

			 <p>The week before Easter was once again very quiet in terms of new software and tech-related stuff. This was probably also because there was a lot to do at work before we went on our Easter vacation. For a few years now, we have been traveling more or less regularly during the Easter holidays together with my wife&rsquo;s family. She has three siblings, all of whom have partners and children, and our dog joins us as well. This year we went to Belgium, the weather was quite rainy and gray, but that&rsquo;s okay. We were 15 people and, of course, it was very bustling but also very nice. There was a lot of hiking, eating, reading, playing, and laughing. Especially for the younger ones, who let it show more, the fact that there was almost no functioning internet in the area and in the vacation apartment was quite noticeable. Wi-Fi and mobile networks were unusable. It took several minutes just to retrieve a single email. Social media, game streaming, YouTube, etc. were completely unthinkable. Digital detox par excellence. Actually, it did quite good and that was the reason there was also no post here on the blog last week. üê£</p>
<p>Therefore, in brief and in continuation of week <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/03/25/what-caught-my.html">12</a>, here are very few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the 13th and 14th week of 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>üìò During the vacation, I finished my first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly_(novel)">novel</a> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> in a long time and read a second <a href="https://sebastianfitzek.com/buch/das-paket/">book</a> within another day. The third one is also already half done: <a href="https://romero.com/shop/p/doomguy">DOOM Guy: Life in First Person by John Romero</a>. I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought it, but I find the autobiography very interesting so far. (Doom actually had a big impact on me during my school years.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì∑ Also not a novel, but already noted, a new Take Control Book: <a href="https://www.takecontrolbooks.com/iphone-photography/">Take Control of iPhone Photography</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚úçÔ∏è I couldn&rsquo;t resist playing with <a href="https://vincentritter.com">Vincent</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://scribbles.page">Scribbles</a>; I &ldquo;secretly&rdquo; played with a small <a href="https://apps.icymi.lol">side project</a> there, which Habit immediately <a href="https://mastodon.social/@habibcham/112173355622816543">discovered</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üíª Alongside <a href="https://rectangleapp.com/pro">Rectangle Pro</a> and <a href="https://superkey.app/">Superkey</a>, I started trying out another app by <a href="https://ryanhanson.dev/">Ryan Hanson</a>: <a href="https://charmstone.app/">Charmstone</a> - <em>The quicker switcher launcher for macOS</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üñ•Ô∏è I asked on Mastodon for Terminal alternatives and three were mainly mentioned: <a href="https://www.warp.dev/">Warp: Your terminal, reimagined</a>,  <a href="https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html">WezTerm - Wez&rsquo;s Terminal Emulator</a>, and <a href="https://iterm2.com/">iTerm2 - macOS Terminal Replacement</a>. I haven&rsquo;t had the chance yet, but hopefully, I will be able to take a closer look at them over the next week(s).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ I was not aware of how easy it can be on macOS to get Windows games purchased from the Epic Game Store or GOG to run: <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/">Heroic Games Launcher</a> - <em>An Open Source Epic, GOG, and Amazon Prime Games Launcher</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of games: Played <a href="https://tann.itch.io/slice-dice">Slice &amp; Dice</a> and <a href="https://www.playbalatro.com">Balatro</a>. (It&rsquo;s all <a href="https://danielsantos.org/blog/week-12-2024/">Daniel Santos</a>' fault! üòé)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üõ†Ô∏è <a href="https://chrishannah.me/">Chris Hannah</a> released a <a href="https://chrishannah.me/projects/2024/pst-a-cli-tool-to-post-to-microblog/">CLI Tool to Post to Micro.Blog</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üå± Spring is coming and we took this as an opportunity to completely reseed our lawn; it was more of a field than a lawn and therefore urgently needed; we are curious to see if it will turn out well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì∫ No television, no movies, no series in the last two weeks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a pleasant week ahead!</p>

			 <p>In continuation of week <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/03/18/what-caught-my.html">11</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the 12th week of 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>üò¥ Actually, this week was a very quiet week in terms of tech-related stuff. It was probably because I was very busy at work and in the evenings, I preferred to relax with a game of <a href="https://www.playbalatro.com/">Balatro</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> instead of surfing the net a lot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üõ†Ô∏è This week, many things just broke. It started with dishes, not just once, followed by a PS5 controller that wouldn&rsquo;t turn on anymore and got dangerously hot while charging and started to smell. Then, the power supply of the old MacBook simply quit working, a 256 GB USB stick made my Mac crash reproducibly as soon as I tried to access it, the <a href="https://social.lol/@esamecar/112128048360997520">crank handle</a> of my Playdate just broke without any external force<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, our eCargo bike suddenly refused to go any further (Error E010), the coffee machine at work gave up the ghost, and my knee is broken. Well, it&rsquo;s been messed up for 30 years, it just hurts more this week than usual. I think that&rsquo;s a good sign for next week. It can only get better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üîÑ The developer of <a href="https://anybox.app/">Anybox</a> has released a new app: <a href="https://pinning.app/">Event countdown &amp; up - Pinning app</a>. I was a long-time user of <a href="https://countdowns-app.com/">Countdowns</a> before I switched to <a href="https://upaheadapp.com/">Up Ahead</a> because the latter was much more fun to use. However, there has been no update for over ten months, and I&rsquo;m somewhat reluctant to pay a subscription price for that. I&rsquo;ll take a look at Pinning, although there is no macOS version yet and it also has a subscription model behind it. Otherwise, I should dig out Countdowns again. It works wonderfully, it just doesn&rsquo;t look nice at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéâ <a href="https://social.lol/@robb/112122739225364588">Robb</a> announced that his Podcast Ruminate joined MacStories. Congrats!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ü§î I was curious and also signed up for <a href="https://scribbles.page">Scribbles</a>. I definitely don&rsquo;t need another way to blog, but I kind of like the projects by <a href="https://vincentritter.com">Vincent</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üß© <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/table-of-contents-for-safari/id1665115607">Table of contents ‚Äî for Safari on the App¬†Store</a>: A funny little plugin that does exactly what it promises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ù§Ô∏è I was absolutely impressed that I sent a feature request to the developer of <a href="https://www.stclairsoft.com/DefaultFolderX/">Default Folder X</a> and he replied on the same day that he had implemented the feature and it will be included in the next release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üê∂ Besides, I was pleased that you can now use Siri in German without saying &ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; This solves our biggest mistake in dog training. We chose &ldquo;Hey&rdquo; as a stop signal (&ldquo;no&rdquo;) for our dog, and therefore we could only ask the Homepods to do things via voice very limitedly, otherwise, we would completely confuse our dog every time üòÖ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ I&rsquo;ve finished <a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/super-mario-land-2-6-golden-coins">Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins</a> (GB) on my Analogue Pocket and started playing <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_vs._Donkey_Kong">Mario vs. Donkey Kong</a> (GBA). The next real Mario game will be <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-64/Super-Mario-64-269745.html">Super Mario 64</a>. I&rsquo;ve been thinking a bit about how and on which system I want to play it. I&rsquo;ve decided to buy the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-64-controller/">Nintendo 64 bluetooth controller</a> and try it on the Switch via Nintendo Switch Online Plus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üé• We watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/movies/the-shawshank-redemption-1994">The Shawshank Redemption (1994)</a> (again) with our sons. What a damn good movie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üé∏ I was at an <a href="https://www.idlesband.com">IDLES</a> concert ü§ò.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a wonderfull week ahead!</p>

			 <p>In continuation of week <a href="XXX">10</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the 11. week of 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>üëÄ <a href="https://social.lol/@adam">Adam</a> is once again working on something new: <a href="https://neato.pub/">Neato</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üè¶ IndieAppSales 2024 was going on last week and I <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/03/12/indieappsales.html">bought some new apps</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì± Just like for <a href="https://ia.net/presenter">iA Presenter</a>, there is now also an iOS version of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/deckset/id6476942011?ign-mpt=uo%3D4">‚ÄéDeckset</a>. I had hoped that it might do without a subscription, but far from it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üñ•Ô∏è <a href="https://www.gentlemencoders.com/nitro-for-macos/index.html">Nitro for macOS</a> might be something to keep an eye on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìÜ Currently, I also have no use for this, but I can imagine that might change: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/rules-shortcuts-based-on-event/id6461118886?mt=12">‚ÄéRules Shortcuts based on Event</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üíé Here I found a few <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> gems: <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=D2_8qJi2jpQ">Hidden FREE Mac Apps!</a>. Especially interesting I found <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/mailsy#default">mailsy</a>, <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/speedtest-cli#default">speedtest-cli</a>, <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ata#default">ata</a>, <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/wifi-password#default">wifi-password</a>, <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/mas#default">mas</a>, and <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/yt-dlp#default">yt-dlp</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéµ There are media control apps for macOS now like sand by the sea, but this one is free and looks quite nice: <a href="https://www.martinfekete.com/Tuneful">Tuneful</a> - <em>Control your music with ease</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2533960/SUMMERHOUSE/">Summerhouse (Steam)</a> looks cozy, and thanks to <a href="https://micro.danielsantos.org/2024/03/16/week.html">Daniel</a> I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.playbalatro.com/">Balatro</a>. In addition there were (are?) significant discounts on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/70300/VVVVVV/">VVVVVV</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/">Celeste on Steam</a> . I especially suck at the latter on the <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=2145">pico-8</a> but I adore its aesthetic and am excited to play it on my MacBook.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üïπÔ∏è For the Playdate, I stumbled upon <a href="https://tedbrakob.itch.io/">Quandino</a> and bought <a href="https://marsaftermidnight.com/">Mars After Midnight</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì∫ I did not know now that <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=1H3dTVuNvzs">Retro Gaming on the Amazon Fire TV Stick</a> is a thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üé• <a href="https://wikiflix.toolforge.org/#/">Wikiflix</a>: an interface to browse, search, and view movies published as public domain at Wikimedia Commons, the Internet Archive, or YouTube.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üöÄ Nice idea and cool implementation, for which, however, I have no necessity: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ipulse-monitor-your-device/id6474695786">‚ÄéiPulse - Monitor Your Device</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üòì <a href="https://mastodon.social/@habibcham">Habib</a> wrote about <a href="https://www.chamline.net/overwhelming-tech-fatigue/">Overwhelming Tech Fatigue</a>. I too have been feeling an increasing kind of dissatisfaction with technical devices in general lately. I am becoming more intolerant regarding shortcomings, especially of the system&rsquo;s software. I yearn for things to simply function and find myself increasingly reluctant to invest significant time in troubleshooting things that have been implemented with minimal effort and, as a result, are prone to errors. (Although I still like trying out new software and starting new projects ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.) I suspect that this actually has to do with age. In the past, I passionately tinkered with (Windows) PCs but eventually had no more desire to spend more time making things work than using them.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I then switched to Apple because its OS and software was (seemingly) much more thoughtful, functional, stable, and beautiful. This love is massively being lost in recent months, and since there seem to be no real alternatives, turning away from the enthusiasm for technology itself would be the next logical step - even though I don&rsquo;t actively pursue that of course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ú® There seem to be only two opinions about <a href="https://trakt.tv/movies/asteroid-city-2023">Asteroid City</a>, and I belong to the fraction that had a lot of fun watching it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéâ Celebrated my birthday, had a lot of good food and nice people around me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ü™ô Last but not least, go and check out the <a href="https://oneamonth.club/">One a Month Club</a> and become a member of all those great blogs listed there üòé</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a nice week! üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

			 <p>In continuation of week <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/02/25/what-caught-my.html">8</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the 9. week of 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>üé• Inspired by <a href="https://social.lol/@jason">Jason&rsquo;s</a> awesome <a href="https://grepjason.sh/2024/officespace-gif">OfficeSpace.gif</a>, we (re)watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/movies/office-space-1999">Office Space (1999)</a> as a family. We had a lot of fun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üòÜ Cool: <a href="https://rss-is-dead.lol/">RSS IS DEAD LOL</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìö Bookmarked <a href="https://calibresync.bitbucket.io/">Calibre Sync</a>. It seems like a great way to access your Calibre library on the go. I&rsquo;m thinking about moving my library to my NAS and sharing it via WebDAV.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üíª A few years ago, I had this little Finder Service installed that let me change folder colors via the context menu. Somehow, it was not migrated to my new MacBook, and I had a hard time finding it on the web again: <a href="https://github.com/neilsardesai/Manila/releases">Manila</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üõ†Ô∏è This might come in handy at times: <a href="https://github.com/ninxsoft/Mist">Mist</a> - <em>A Mac utility that automatically downloads macOS Firmwares / Installers</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üîÑ <a href="https://github.com/jacklandrin/OnlySwitch">OnlySwitch</a> for macOS was updated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ If I had a PSP Go and shipping did not cost three times the price of the adapter, I would have bought this right away: <a href="https://geniusgamemods.com/collections/frontpage/products/psp-go-micro-sd-memory-card-adapter-kit">Micro SD Memory Card Adapter for the PSP Go</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì± There was a lot of buzz about the changes in the upcoming iOS version to comply with the European Union&rsquo;s Digital Markets Act (DMA). One positive outcome might be this: <a href="https://macpaw.com/news/setapp-ios-beta-announcement">MacPaw Announces Upcoming Beta Version of Setapp Mobile</a>. Now, I&rsquo;m just waiting for retro gaming emulators to be released for iOS on an alternate store.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üïπÔ∏è Right now, <a href="https://initialcharge.net/2024/02/emulation-on-iphone-guide/">Emulation on iPhone</a> is a mess. It&rsquo;s easier to stream PS5 games to your phone or even <a href="https://merecivilian.com/playstation-5-games-on-apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ü§ñ But iOS is not the only complicated platform for emulation (frontends). As mentioned last week, <a href="https://es-de.org">ES-DE</a> was released for Android. The programmer did not get permission to distribute it on the Google Play Store and therefore went to Amazon. They <a href="https://es-de.org/android-amazon">delisted</a> it too, and he had to move to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/es_de/">Patreon</a>. Anyway, it&rsquo;s a bit finicky to set up but runs very well on my Retroid Pocket 2S.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ On my Anbernic RG35XX, I stumbled upon <a href="https://thelettervsixtim.es/index.html">VVVVVV</a>. How could I have ignored this for so long?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üê∏ Came across <a href="https://timbojay.itch.io/bubblefrog">Bubble Frog by Timbo Johnson</a>. It&rsquo;s a lovely little game for the Game Boy, and the developer seems very passionate about his project. You can download it for free on itch.io, and to support him, I backed it on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/timbojay/bubble-frog-a-game-boy-bubbly-adventure">Kickstarter</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üïπÔ∏è BTW, there is a new GBA emulator out there. So, if you collect ROMs and emulators as well, you can get this one: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/s/cuRF9BB6Zf">Hades: A Nintendo Game Boy Advance Emulator v1.0.0 released</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üè∞ Finished <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_Advance_4:_Super_Mario_Bros._3">Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3</a>. This took me a while and was really, really hard at the end. Next, I finished <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_Land">Super Mario Land</a>. This was the opposite; it only took a few hours. Right now, I am playing <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_World:_Super_Mario_Advance_2">Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìö Even though I&rsquo;m not 100% convinced that my purchase of a <a href="https://pocketbook.de/de_de/pocketbook-era-stardust-silver">PocketBook Era</a> was the right decision, I still like the idea of an e-ink reader/tablet. These look really great: <a href="https://shop.boox.com/products/noteair3">BOOX Note Air3 C and Note Air3 Series</a>. I&rsquo;ve never heard of them before, and I wonder if they are more performant than normal e-readers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è My wife and I went for our first bike ride (55 km) of the year outdoors. The weather was fantastic, and there was a hint of spring in the air. It was beautiful.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to (re)play all the <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_(series)#Main_games">main Mario games</a> in chronological order but don&rsquo;t necessarily stick to the original platform.

			 <p>Continuing from week <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/02/19/what-caught-my.html">07</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the eighth week of 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>üì± <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/simple-scan-quick-scanner/id6477965455">Simple Scan ‚Ä¢ Quick Scanner</a> was teased by <a href="https://agiletortoise.com">Agile Tortoise</a>. Curious to see if this will be a better solution than just opening the Files.app and initiating a scan from there. (Actually, I&rsquo;ve never checked if those generated PDFs have automatic OCR.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚òëÔ∏è <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/twodos-simple-todos/id6463499163"> Twodos - Simple Todos</a>: Interesting concept but definitely too basic for my needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üåßÔ∏è <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/looks-like-rain/id6443960587"> Looks Like Rain</a>: Another weather app. It focuses on graphical bars showing the rain tendencies for the next couple of days. I like that because that&rsquo;s the main reason for me to open a weather app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üñ•Ô∏è And another updated utility: <a href="https://dockexpose.netlify.app/">Dock Expos√© - MacOS window previews on the dock</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üê¨ <a href="https://flipperzero.one/">Flipperzero - Portable Multi-tool Device for Geeks</a>. I totally missed the <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/opinion/the-flipper-zero-has-gotten-a-bad-rap-why-i-love-this-little-hacking-tool">hype</a> about this device and am not that tech-savvy, but somehow I wish I was able to do something with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ü§î I still don&rsquo;t quite understand why I am still looking for alternatives to <a href="https://anybox.app/">Anybox</a>. The only thing that bothers me about the app is that the sync speed is a bit too sluggish for my taste. Everything else is great. Regardless, after I took a closer look at <a href="https://www.witt-software.com/linkcluster/">Link Cluster</a> <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/02/19/what-caught-my.html">last week</a>, this week there was an update for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/linkeeper/id6449708232">Linkeeper</a>. The new version also looks quite promising but unfortunately does not support the import of bookmark collections as an .html file. And therefore, there is no easy way for me to migrate my bookmarks. I&rsquo;ll keep both Apps in mind, though.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üõ†Ô∏è Stumbled upon <a href="https://www.zint.org.uk/">Zint</a> - <em>a complete cross-platform open source barcode generating solution</em>. For individual QR codes, I still use V2 of QR Factory, which is now available in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/qr-factory-3/id1609285899">Version 3</a>. Zint is only available as a CLI on the Mac but I&rsquo;ll keep it in mind in case I want to generate a lot of codes automatically someday.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üíª Mainly for work, I revisited various ChatGPT / LLM frontends and local LLMs. I had somehow completely lost track of the tools and their capabilities. In the process, I stumbled upon <a href="https://mindmac.app/">MindMac - Connect seamlessly, chat effortlessly with ChatGPT on macOS</a>. It&rsquo;s a (not very pretty) GUI for more or less all the AI services in the world. Together with <a href="https://openrouter.ai/">OpenRouter</a>, you can quickly and easily try out the major commercial APIs (OpenAI, Google Gemini, etc.), but also, for example, integrate a range of local LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Llava) with the help of <a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama">ollama</a>. Even uploading images is possible, and the integration of the Google Search API for queries that do not allow online searches. (If you only want to use Ollama with a GUI, there is also, for example, <a href="https://github.com/kevinhermawan/Ollamac">Ollamac - A macOS app for interacting with the Ollama models</a>). In addition, MindMac also combines <a href="https://lmstudio.ai/">LM Studio</a> and <a href="https://www.gpt4all.io/">GPT4All</a> under its interface. The developer is also extremely helpful. I like the app. Apart from that, at the end of the day (more or less in the truest sense of the word), I had to realize once again that ALL of these LLMs are still not capable of doing what I hope for them. Serious work on scientific texts is simply not possible with them. The models make too many mistakes and fail at seemingly simple tasks. I&rsquo;ll take another look at this in six months. But it does scare me a bit that these tools are probably already being (supposedly) used productively in many related areas.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

<p>üí° I&rsquo;ve learned quite a bit from JDHeyburn&rsquo;s <a href="https://jdheyburn.co.uk/blog/how-i-use-obsidian-to-journal/#conclusion">How I use Obsidian to journal</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ As mentioned last week, I really enjoy <a href="https://batocera.org">EmulationStation</a> on my Anbernic <a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg35xx-h">RG35XX H</a> (for which a <a href="https://github.com/rg35xx-cfw/rg35xx-cfw.github.io/releases/tag/rg35xx_plus_h_batocera_20240220">new release</a> was just published) and Raspberry Pi. Actually, there was no reason, but this week I&rsquo;ve installed <a href="https://es-de.org/#Download">ES-DE Frontend (EmulationStation Desktop Edition)</a> on my MacBook. Next, I will try to get the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CVXRHWTT">Android</a> version running on my Retroid Pocket 2S. According to <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=qGqOSvh2UjQ">Retro Game Corps</a>, it might not be that hard. IMHO it&rsquo;s just the best Retroarch / Emulation frontend and it&rsquo;s fun tinkering around with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ I wanted to check something on playstation.com this week and had to enter my password three or four times, provide a 2FA code, and solve a CAPTCHA. WTF!? That&rsquo;s why I took the opportunity to switch my account to a <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/passkey/?country-selector=true#09">Passkey</a>. I am curious to see what hurdles Sony will now put in my way when using it.</p>

			 <p>Continuing from week <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/02/12/what-caught-my.html">06</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the seventh week of 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>üëå So, I think I&rsquo;ve read and seen enough about the Apple Vision Pro for now. I hope I&rsquo;ll stay firm and wait at least for Gen 2 and not want to buy it as soon as the AVP is available in Germany. However, I still find this video noteworthy: <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=eOH33sWgds8">What Reviewers Aren‚Äôt Telling You About Apple Vision Pro</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üò§ <a href="https://social.lol/@esamecar/111945573099378265">Gruber&rsquo;s polemics</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/02/eu_rcs_imessage">European Union bashing</a> are getting on my nerves. I&rsquo;m going to remove him from my RSS reader and podcast player for a while. Maybe then my Watch won&rsquo;t complain about an elevated pulse even though I&rsquo;m not currently training. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üé∂ Last week I mentioned <a href="https://www.algoriddim.com/">algoriddim djay</a>, which now also supports Apple Music, and this week I came across <a href="https://mixxx.org/news/2024-02-16-mixxx-2-4-0-features/">Mixxx</a> in my Mastodon timeline for the first time. (Sorry, I can&rsquo;t find where I saw it right now.) It doesn&rsquo;t seem to support any streaming services, but it is open source and therefore free to try.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üé® Well, as said I can&rsquo;t make music and I can&rsquo;t draw either, but I found this app interesting: <a href="https://astropad.com/product/slate/">astropad slate</a> - <em>Control your Mac using your iPad and Apple Pencil</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üîó In <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/02/03/what-caught-my.html">week 5</a> I briefly looked into <a href="https://www.witt-software.com/linkcluster/">Link Cluster</a> but due to its lacking ability to copy links in Markdown format it was no real alternative to <a href="https://anybox.app/">Anybox</a> for me. I sent Link Cluster&rsquo;s developer a feature request and this week version 2.1 was released. Among many other new features, you can now copy MD links but unfortunately there is still no share sheet extension for adding links on iOS. So, still on my watch list but no real alternative to <a href="https://anybox.app/">Anybox</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üñºÔ∏è <a href="https://lowtechguys.com/clop/">Clop</a> - <em>Image, video, PDF and clipboard optimiser Copy large, paste small, send fast</em>: There&rsquo;s plenty of software for shrinking, for single images, for <a href="https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/">batch</a> processes or even as a <a href="https://github.com/xryul/obsidian-image-converter">plugin</a> for Obsidian. Clop monitors the clipboard or directories and optimises images and videos. It&rsquo;s also available on <a href="https://setapp.com/apps/clop">Setapp</a>. I will definitely take a look at it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì∏ I don&rsquo;t understand why Apple doesn&rsquo;t offer a way in Photos.app to compare several photos from a series and specifically select the best one. I even briefly subscribed to Lightroom because it offers a brilliant X|Y comparison function. But since I didn&rsquo;t really need most of the other functions, the subscription costs were of course not justifiable. I bought <a href="https://www.houdah.com/photosWorkbench/">Photos Workbench</a>, but I didn&rsquo;t really get along with the app - I have no idea why ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. For iOS, there is now <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/photoscope-storage-cleaner/id6474432385">Photoscope - Storage Cleaner</a>, which I will take a closer look at, but of course it won&rsquo;t be able to replace a macOS app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìù <a href="https://www.reorproject.org/">Reor</a> - <em>AI note-taking app that runs models locally</em>: Looks interesting, especially in combination with lots of MD files you already store e.g. in Obsidian, but I don&rsquo;t get the difference between all those LLM available. I have to dig a little bit deeper into this, I guess. I just tried it with TheBloke/DiscoLM_German_7b_v1-GGUF and a sample collection of 5,300 text files and the results were very, very disappointing. Can&rsquo;t recommend it yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ü§ñ Speaking of AI. Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction">Gemini</a> is now supposed to understand books in a fraction of a second and Open AI&rsquo;s <a href="https://openai.com/sora">Sora</a> can now create videos. I can&rsquo;t keep up. Today, I asked <a href="http://perplexity.ai">Perplexity</a> to extract the first 25 hits from a Tier List from a website and the LLM absolutely refused to maintain the correct order. But why start small when you can make <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1arrqpz/funny_glitch_with_sora_interesting_how_it_looks/">chairs float</a> ‚Ä¶</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üóÇÔ∏è After reading <a href="https://social.lol/@robb">Robb</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/three-months-of-the-johnny-decimal-system/">Three Months of The Johnny Decimal System</a> I decided to preorder <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@johnnydecimal">Johnny</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://jdcm.al/10-19-concepts/14-build-your-system/14.03-the-decimal-workshop/">Workshop</a>. I&rsquo;ve been using the basic concept <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> of the <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com/00-09-site-administration/00-index/">Johnny.Decimal System</a> for many years (I would claim ten, but I don&rsquo;t know how long it&rsquo;s been around actually), but especially in a work context I eventually hit my limits with the system and am curious if I can apply it even better if I engage with it more intensively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ I spent way too much time with <a href="https://batocera.org">Batocara.linux</a> this week. I installed it on a Raspberry Pi and a <a href="https://github.com/rg35xx-cfw/rg35xx-cfw.github.io/releases">derivative</a> of it on the <a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg35xx-h">Anbernic RG35XX H</a>. Wow, I&rsquo;m very impressed with what&rsquo;s possible with it. It looks so stunning ü•∞.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì∫ Continued watching <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/for-all-mankind/seasons/4">For All Mankind S04</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üòä My mood was better than last week but not perfect. I hope yours is and have a nice week ahead!</p>

<p>Speaking of training, since the beginning of the year I&rsquo;ve been doing workouts six to seven days a week (sometimes only for 15 min), of which I ride 5 - 6 times on the trainer (30 - 60 min). It&rsquo;s actually way too strenuous for me, but my FTP at the end of the week attested me a significant jump üéâ . Now I just need to muster the strength to lose 10 kg. But phew, one thing at a time.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			 <p>Continuing from week <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/02/03/what-caught-my.html">05</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the sixth week of 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/02/03/what-caught-my.html">Last week</a>, I failed to configure my Mac as a WIFI Access Point with NordVPN. This week, I tried to do it with a Raspberry Pi 4. Since I no longer have a monitor with an HDMI input, I connected the Raspi using a micro-HDMI to HDMI adapter, HDMI cable, HDMI Capture Card with a USB-A connection, and a USB-A to USB-C hub to my iPad ü§Ø What a mess but it worked with <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id6459355072">HDMI Monitor - Orion</a> perfectly fine. I then tried to set up an AP with the help of <a href="https://docs.raspap.com/">RaspAP</a> and install NordVPN on the Raspi. No matter what I tried, my devices just don&rsquo;t want to connect to the Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s WLAN, although my iPhone briefly did in hotspot mode and everything seems to work in principle. Well, failed again ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üò¢.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üíø I <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-install-m2-ssd/">upgraded</a> my PS5&rsquo;s disk space. It now has an additional 2 TB internal SSD. It took me less than 2 minutes; what an alternative universe it would be if it were the same on a Mac.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üí° Adam had a cool idea again: <a href="https://notes.neatnik.net/">Neatnik Notes ¬∑ URL as a sentence</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì± I enjoyed reading Hiro&rsquo;s first impressions of his <a href="https://hiro.report/2024/02/05/hiroreport-vision-pro.html">Ô£ø Vision Pro</a> and was <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/02/05/apple-vision-pro.html">wondering about the future</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üïπÔ∏è So far, I use <a href="https://github.com/mattpannella/pupdate">Pupdate</a> to update my Analogue Pocket. Looked briefly into <a href="https://github.com/neil-morrison44/pocket-sync">pocket-sync: A GUI tool for doing stuff with the Analogue Pocket</a>, but I think I will stick to Pupdate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üò¢ I lost all my Save Files for my Analogue Pocket, mainly Super Marios Bros. games. I cried a little bit and now have to start all over with Super Mario Advance 4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ It&rsquo;s somehow cool that there is still a lot of great stuff released for the Game Boy, like <a href="https://mhughson.itch.io/from-below-pocket">From Below Pocket by Matt Hughson (NES Dev)</a> or <a href="https://skittlesfiddles.itch.io/repugnant-bounty">Repugnant Bounty by Repugnant Bounty</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéµ I really enjoy using <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/longplay/id1495152002">Longplay</a> on the iPhone. There is now also <a href="https://adrianschoenig.gumroad.com/l/longplay">Longplay for Mac (Early Access)</a>, but I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s worth $25+ to me at the moment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìà I stumbled upon another Obsidian plugin: <a href="https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker">obsidian-tracker</a> - <em>A plugin tracks occurrences and numbers in your notes</em>. You can really dive deep into it if you want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üé∂ Unfortunately, I lack any major DJ skills, but still had a lot of fun at parties in the past with algoriddim djay; that was back when people weren&rsquo;t streaming 100% of their music and still owned stuff. Unfortunately it was not possible with Apple Music. Years after its launch, that finally changed: <a href="https://www.algoriddim.com/">algoriddim djay</a> - <em>Now with Apple Music Integration</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ö° This <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGCR138W">Portable Wireless Charger for Apple Watch</a> looks interesting. My S7 only has 80% of its initial capacity and this might be handy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üö¥ I first watched the making of, <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QAV51eiO0S8">Riding the hardest Ski Race track on a bicycle (with Spikes)</a>, and then the actual video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fF5dA5ta5hI">Fabio Wibmer - THE STREIF</a>. Infinitely insane and great to see the immense preparations needed to capture such an extraordinary performance on film.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üé• Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/movies/the-big-sick-2017">The Big Sick</a> together with my wife and <a href="https://trakt.tv/movies/the-marvels-2023">The Marvels</a> with the whole family. Enjoyed the first one, and the latter wasn&rsquo;t that bad either. It was quite amusing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üòî My mood has been extremely bad this week. I&rsquo;m sure everything will be better next week. I hope you have a great week too!</p>

			<h1><a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/02/05/apple-vision-pro.html">Apple Vision Pro - a glimpse of the future?</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/02/05/apple-vision-pro.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-02-05 13:00:25 &#43;0100">Feb 5, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>After <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price">reading</a> and <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=GkPw6ScHyb4">watching</a> selected reports about the Apple Vision Pro, the consensus seems to be that the experience is absolutely unique. Although, it seems to be just the beginning of something really big to come due to its many existing <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/the_vision_pro">shortcomings</a> (weight, battery life, bulkiness, price etc.). Therefore, the device is more of a vision what Spatial Computing could be like in the future. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if, in a few years, we could wear cheaper and especially much lighter and smaller glasses that discreetly answer all our questions anywhere or project a cinema screen in front of our faces, even though we&rsquo;re sitting on a <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=UvkgmyfMPks">bench on the Times Square</a>? Similar to how the iPhone initially had a number of shortcomings (price, EDGE, no copy and paste, no app store, no video recording, poor camera, etc.) that have now been almost completely eliminated, the next few years will also provide a far better Spatial Computing experience.</p>
<p>However, I wonder whether this will really be the case with the Apple Vision Pro, or whether we will only see improved versions of the current hardware in the foreseeable future, but no radical shift or further development that the reviewers / YouTubers are dreaming of.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Will it really be possible to project non-transparent objects into our eyes without completely shielding them from ambient light? But as long as this is not the case, we will have to continue walking around<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> with far too large, bulky, ski goggles tailored exactly to the wearer&rsquo;s face, and no, this is definitely not the future I want to experience.</p>
<section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>I mean, the iPhone and the Apple Watch have definitely improved a lot over the years, but fundamentally neither of these two devices has evolved from the first version into a new dimension.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>I actually mean exactly that - walking around. I can already see the great potential of the Vision Pro when you&rsquo;re more or less in one place (couch, workplace), but I wonder whether the vision of &ldquo;everyone wearing one of these devices everywhere and at all times&rdquo; can actually be realized with this concept.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Continuing from week <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/01/28/what-caught-my.html">04</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the fifth week of 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>üéÆ This week I had to repeatedly curb my nearly uncontrollable urge to buy gadgets I don&rsquo;t need - so far quite successfully. I did not order the <a href="https://www.ayaneo.com/product/AYANEO-NEXT-LITE.html">Ayaneo Next LITE</a> nor pledged the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ayaneo-flip-world-1st-dual-screen-windows-handheld--2#/">Ayaneo Flip - World 1st Dual-Screen Windows Handheld</a> on Indiegogo. I definitely do not need more gaming handhelds at the moment, even though I don&rsquo;t own one that supports Windows games yet. My backlog is already long enough, I don&rsquo;t need another platform with even more games that I will never play. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üïπÔ∏è One of the games therein is <a href="https://exok.com/games/celeste/">Celeste</a> for the Switch or Playstation. It <a href="https://retrododo.com/celeste-64/">seems to be an absolute classic</a> and I only know the version for the <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=2145">pico-8</a>, where it all started. It&rsquo;s really hard and so far I can&rsquo;t even get past the third (or fourth?) screen. Regardless, there is now a version as a homage to the N64 area: <a href="https://maddymakesgamesinc.itch.io/celeste64">Celeste 64: Fragments of the Mountain by Maddy Makes Games, Heidy Motta, Noel, saint11</a>. Unfortunately not yet for the Mac, but in the comments you could already read that it is technically quite possible and probably will come.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üñ•Ô∏è Speaking of gaming on the Mac: This week <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/death-stranding-directors-cut/id6449748961">Death Stranding Director&rsquo;s Cut</a> was released. I hadn&rsquo;t dealt with the game so far, I don&rsquo;t know either the original version for the PS4 or the Director&rsquo;s Cut for the PS5. Unlike Resident Evil 4, which recently appeared for Apple&rsquo;s devices, this was an opportunity to get an AAA game for macOS at a reasonable price that I hadn&rsquo;t played before. And wow, I am absolutely impressed by the graphics on my MacBook Pro M2 so far. Holy shit, I mean, wow. So far I was not considering a Mac being able to do such a thing. Whether the actual game will appeal to me, I still have to find out, but as a tech demo it has definitely already picked me up. To be able to play it better, I bought a <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/pro2/">Pro 2 Controller</a> from 8BitDo. At first I despaired of their product portfolio, <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and then I realized that I could have used an old PS4 controller. Well, what can you do. I guess, now I am not only somehow collecting retro handhelds, but also game controllers &hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚è±Ô∏è The release of Death Stranding was well timed, as I finished the story of Diablo IV after about 56 hours of playtime this week. I can note for myself that I always take about twice as long for a game as indicated on <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/71960">HowLongToBeat</a> ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. My Rogue is now level 49 and I will definitely tackle the end game again, at least until I reach level 50 with her. I enjoyed the game, but Diablo IV did not 100% convince me. At first it overwhelmed me with its complexity and its own language for all the facets of the game. The whole system seems unnecessarily complicated to me and later the gameplay became quiet repetitive. And all this in-game loot box up sell shit really got on my nerves. I mean, you buy a full price game and then you&rsquo;re constantly being thrown  pointless IAPs for up to 150 ‚Ç¨ in your face. Seriously?! Anyway, in the next few weeks I think I will focus again on Super Marios Bros. 3 (GBA) on my <a href="https://www.analogue.co">Analogue</a> Pocket and look maybe at smaller indie titles on the console at most. Then I see if I enjoy Death Stranding. Maybe I&rsquo;ll understand the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QLq2k22AB0">trailer for part 2</a> better afterwards?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ BTW what definitely interests me more than a Windows handheld is the now possibly upcoming Switch 2 this year and I found the rumors that <a href="https://retrododo.com/ps-vitas-successor-is-reportedly-on-the-way/">The PS Vita&rsquo;s Successor Is Reportedly On The Way &amp; Compatible With PS4/PS5 Titles</a> interesting, too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì± I also did not give in to my impulse to pre-order a rabbit <a href="https://www.rabbit.tech/">r1 - your pocket companion</a>. I find the r1 very exciting as a concept study. I like the design, which comes from the <a href="https://teenage.engineering">same pen</a> as the <a href="https://play.date">playdate</a>. However, the r1 would not be delivered to Europe until the second half of the year anyways, and if the rumors are true, hopefully a usable AI will also be included in <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/01/tim-cook-apple-ai-ios-18/">iOS 18</a> in the fall. Ultimately, of course, something like this belongs in the smartphone, and I therefore see the r1 at best as a cute gimmick, without a real future. But that&rsquo;s not a reason not to have fun with a toy, is it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üíª If I understood correctly, the r1 uses <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai">perplexity.ai</a>, about which I have read a lot of good things lately. Therefore, I wanted to take a closer look at this service, but their Cloudflare configuration initially did not want to <a href="https://social.lol/@esamecar/111861940258698097">let me play along</a> with Safari ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I don&rsquo;t know what exactly Cloudflare didn&rsquo;t like, the check also came with the Arc browser, but disappeared after some time. I&rsquo;m not really convinced yet, but I definitely need to use the service more to form a final opinion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üåê Speaking of <a href="https://arc.net">Arc Browser</a>, I suspect that <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/arc-search/id6472513080"> Arc Search</a> also uses <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai">perplexity.ai</a>, especially since it can be configured as the default search engine in Arc. I am still not 100% convinced by the browser, either. It all seems a bit strange and opaque to me (why do I need an account to surf the web?!) <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and I find the browser itself quite sluggish and already a  bit bloated. I also don&rsquo;t know what to make of this <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/the-browser-company-announces-act-ii-for-arc-the-browser-that-browses-for-you/">Act II</a>. Anyway, there were very <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/arc-search-for-iphone/">enthusiastic reports</a> about Arc Search, but the app hasn&rsquo;t really picked me up yet by now. I will force myself to use it more often in the next few days in order to be able to form a better opinion.</p>

<p>üöÄ I stumbled upon this post in my RSS Reader - <a href="https://www.blast-o-rama.com/2024/01/30/the-iconfactory-looks-to-launch-project-tapestry-via-kickstarter/">The Iconfactory Looks To Launch PROJECT TAPESTRY via Kickstarter</a> - and more or less backed the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iconfactory/project-tapestry">Early Bird Special</a> immediately: <em>With Project Tapestry, we&rsquo;ll create a universal, chronological timeline for iOS for any data that‚Äôs publicly available on the Internet.</em> Who doesn&rsquo;t like the guys from <a href="https://iconfactory.com">The Iconfactory</a> and after the whole Twitter debacle a year ago, I&rsquo;m happy to support the developers. I&rsquo;m curious to see if an app will ultimately come out that I find useful, and if not, at least I was able to follow the development and had access to some nice <a href="https://wallaroo.app">wallpapers</a> for a year ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Not coincidentally, <a href="https://gloria.social/@rizzi/111856959119832404">Silvio Rizzi</a> announced his new app a few days later: <em>A new app, completely rebuilt and rethought from the ground up. This probably won‚Äôt replace the current Reeder (not going away) for a lot of users.</em> He also didn&rsquo;t miss the opportunity to show Project Tapestry directly in his screenshot üòà.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>üìé As announced <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/01/28/what-caught-my.html">last week</a>, I took a look at <a href="https://www.witt-software.com/linkcluster/">Link Cluster</a> - <em>Collect and manage links</em>. In principle, I like the app, but it yet lacks the ability to copy links as Markdown links, and that alone is a reason for me to stick with <a href="https://anybox.app/">Anybox</a> for now. Therefore, I have not yet bought the full version and cannot assess how Link Cluster handles large bookmark collections. But I will definitely continue to follow the development of the app.</p>

<p>I was very happy and honoured that <a href="https://social.lol/@mihobu">Michael</a> included my little site in his <a href="https://mihobu.lol/blogroll">blogroll</a>. I also enjoy reading his posts a lot, so its mutual. I also need to revise my own <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/blogroll/">blogroll</a>, I just have to find the time to do it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìµ At the beginning of the year, I had resolved to give up certain things for a few months, each for a month. In January, I started with giving up alcohol and today I realized that it is already February. My problem now is that all the things I had thought of not doing for February, I have already done in the last three days ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Now what?! I think I just have to spend February without consuming alcohol as well and prepare better for March ü§£ On my list of ideas is also &ldquo;A month without a smartphone&rdquo; or &ldquo;A month without an Apple Watch&rdquo;. That seems too crazy to me right now, and maybe I&rsquo;ll combine it into a &ldquo;A month less gadgets&rdquo; and give up my iPhone or my watch for &ldquo;only&rdquo; a week each, like Arne did with his <a href="https://arne.me/articles/i-lived-7-days-without-a-smartphone">phone</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üòÇ When I read this, I had to laugh a lot:<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Deutsche-Bahn-sucht-Admin-fuer-Windows-3-11-for-Workgroups-9611543.html">Deutsche Bahn sucht Admin f√ºr Windows 3.11 for Workgroups</a>, which means &ldquo;Deutsche Bahn is looking for an Admin for Windows 3.11 for Workgroups&rdquo; and immediately thought of <a href="https://norden.social/@racemase/111341692772365841">my photo</a> which I took in one of our, oh so modern, ICE trains last November.</p>
</li>

<p>üìö I stumbled upon this at <a href="https://heydingus.net/blog/2024/1/7-things-this-week-129">Hey Dingus</a>: <a href="https://www.perry.qa/morse">Learn Morse Code</a>. I would also like to learn something like this. But first, I should probably start refreshing the tying of various <a href="https://www.animatedknots.com/">knots</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üç™ I printed a very large <a href="https://www.printables.com/de/model/658952-giant-oreo-container">Oreo cookie</a>. It weighs (not just a feeling) a good half kilogram, consists of six parts, has hardly any space inside but is absolutely awesome. In addition, I printed a <a href="https://www.printables.com/de/model/56004-homepod-mini-stand">HomePod Mini stand</a> for ours in the kitchen. This way it might survive a disaster better. I also like this <a href="https://www.printables.com/de/model/518689-apple-watch-stand">Apple Watch Stand</a> and while I was at it, I also printed <a href="https://www.printables.com/de/model/423218-snes-cartridge-holder-pal">SNES Cartridge Holder (PAL)</a> and the <a href="https://www.printables.com/de/model/512566-n64-single-cartridge-display-stand">N64 Single Cartridge Display Stand</a> for my Super Mario cartridges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üñ®Ô∏è The next project for my <a href="https://www.ankermake.com/eu-en/m5?ref=naviMenu_2_2_img">AnkerMake M5</a> is to take a closer look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra_9zU-mnl8">Gridfinity</a>. It seems to me to be a <a href="https://gridfinity.xyz">nice system</a>. Now I just need to figure out which base plates I can best use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üíª This week I wanted to use a VPN connection with a device that is only WLAN capable. Since there is no way to set up a VPN service directly on the device, I thought it should be easy to make my Mac&rsquo;s VPN connection available to other devices via WLAN Sharing. Well, far from it. Basically, it seems to be possible somehow, but unfortunately not with the help of <a href="https://nordvpn.com/">NordVPN</a>, my until now used VPN provider üò¢.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üëå In the Apple universe, of course, the launch of the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> was the event of the week. The usual suspects have already <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/the_vision_pro">written</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price">published videos</a> extensively about it. As a European, I will thankfully not be confronted with the question of whether it might be worth the money for me in the next couple months. Basically, I am of course extremely fascinated and would give a lot to be able to try it out. Especially the entertainment aspect appeals to me, because my better half only tolerates a tiny 32&quot; TV in the living room, <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> and not only having a home cinema, but a whole iMAX cinema in my own four walls, of course appears extremely tempting. However, I am also not sure what would happen if I used a VisionPro at home in her presence, I at least only dared to use the PS VR 1 when she was out &hellip; ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìù Last but not least, <a href="https://mas.to/@obsidian/111863007663904581">Obsidian</a> now also offers servers outside the USA. I therefore moved my private Obsidian vault to a European server and immediately imagine that the synchronization is faster. Apart from that, I find it better anyway to know my data in a European data center.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì∫ Continued watching <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/for-all-mankind/seasons/4">For All Mankind</a> S4 with my wife. I enjoy this TV show but it definitely does not make you happy or confident.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Continuing from week <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/01/22/what-caught-my.html">03</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the fourth week of 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>üåê I didn&rsquo;t quite understand the commotion about the DMA this week. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/apples_plans_for_the_dma">Gruber</a> proved himself to be a true patriot once again, and I still don&rsquo;t understand where exactly the doomsday mood is coming from. Whether Apple has chosen an appropriate strategy, I don&rsquo;t know either, see also <a href="https://thedent.net/post/apple-ruins-its-big-week-9nanx5jv">Apple ruins its big week</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ My <a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg35xx-h">Anbernic RG35XX H</a> arrived. Now I can sell my RG353PS and send the RGB30 (more or less electronic waste right from the start) to recycling. So far, one is more or less reliant on the stock firmware, which isn&rsquo;t very nice. But there are a number of very young <a href="https://retrohandheldguides.com/rg35xx-h-custom-firmware/">Custom Firmware Projects</a> and also a <a href="https://github.com/cbepx-me/RG35xx-P-RG35xx-H-Modification">cleaned-up stock version</a>. To not lose track of all the associated SD cards, I printed a series of these <a href="https://www.printables.com/de/model/27021-micro-sd-label-sticks">Micro-SD Label Sticks</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üïπÔ∏è I was surprised to learn how easy it is to get <a href="https://youtu.be/KURrNV7jupI?si=brG7PHl53uC_GAQB">The Full AMIGA Experience on Analogue Pocket</a>. Until now, I was also unaware that you can convert save states created with an emulator to and from the Pocket / MISTER: <a href="https://savefileconverter.com/#/mister">Save File Converter</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üõ†Ô∏è I am actually very satisfied with <a href="https://anybox.app">Anybox</a>. Only sometimes I wish that the sync speed would be much faster. I recently archived 20,000 (!) old bookmarks and kept &ldquo;only&rdquo; the last 2k, which only helped to a limited extent in getting the bookmarks stored on the iPhone displayed faster on the Mac. Over the last few years, I&rsquo;ve tried more or less all the alternatives, except for Link Cluster. Its developer <a href="https://witt-software.com">Daniel Witt</a> is not an unknown<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, the app was an up-front one-time purchase, and so far I have been hesitant to pay the money without knowing that the app does better than Anybox. That changed this week. A big update to <a href="https://www.witt-software.com/releasenotes/?app=linkcluster">Version 2.0</a> has been released and you can now (very limited) test it first, which I will definitely do over the next week: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/link-cluster/id6443942506">Link Cluster</a> - <em>Collect and manage links</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì∞ I checked out <a href="https://netnewswire.com">NetNewsWire</a> for macOS again. I will stick with <a href="https://reederapp.com">Reeder</a> for the time being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üíª I changed my window manager again. The app <a href="https://manytricks.com/moom/">Moom</a>, which has been used on my macOS for decades, has now been replaced by <a href="https://rectangleapp.com/pro">Rectangle Pro</a>. <a href="https://ryanhanson.dev">Ryan Hanson</a> is another indie developer who releases just great utilities, and that&rsquo;s why I bought the Pro version right away. Alternatively, you can also use the free <a href="https://rectangleapp.com">Rectangle</a> first. In fact, I can hardly imagine my life without <a href="https://superkey.app">Superkey</a> (alternatively <a href="https://hyperkey.app">Hyperkey</a>) anymore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì± No week without a new app from Sindre: <a href="https://sindresorhus.com/doodle-draw">Doodle Draw</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üè† I hung a very inexpensive Amazon Kindle Fire tablet on the refrigerator a year or two ago and display in a Full Kiosk Browser <a href="https://magicmirror.builders">Magic Mirror2</a>, which runs on a Raspberry Pi. I programmed a series of small Python scripts that show me the energy consumption and our weekly changing family tasks, in addition to standard functions like family calendar, weather, date, time, etc. Unfortunately, I have forgotten most of what I taught myself with Python last year, and for some reason, Magic Mirror can no longer be updated without everything breaking afterwards. I&rsquo;m afraid that if the shaky construct falls apart completely soon, I&rsquo;ll have to hang an old iPad on the wall and perhaps use a solution like the recently updated <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/wallflower-f%C3%BCr-homekit/id1406806705">Wallflower for HomeKit</a> or just understand more about IT, Linux, Python, NPM, and Node ;-)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üèÜ The Obsidian <a href="https://obsidian.md/blog/2023-goty-winners/">2023 Gems of the year winners</a> have been announced. It&rsquo;s a pity that <a href="https://actions.work/actions-for-obsidian">Actions for Obsidian</a> didn&rsquo;t win. While looking at the entries, I stumbled upon <a href="https://youtu.be/djj7QXZAIjM?si=eywCZXEaZMjyGh2r">Data Visualization in Obsidian with Obsidian Charts</a>. There&rsquo;s simply nothing you can&rsquo;t do with Obsidian, albeit much more complicatedly than with other programs better suited for the task. I love that! ü§£</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>‚è∞ The idea of a location-based alarm clock for train rides or similar is great. But I believe I wouldn&rsquo;t have the confidence to rely on this solution: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/wakemehere/id448033390">WakeMeHere</a> - A Location Alarm with Brain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìö I have been diligently reading <a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL34057778W/Holly">Holly</a> - for my standards. However, I am disappointed with the <a href="https://pocketbook.com">PocketBook Era</a>. I had hoped that e-book readers would have evolved somehow over the past ten years. But at least the Era is insanely sluggish, and marking text is an outrage. Well, at least most of the time the text is displayed&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üé¨ Watched <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/998022">The Teachers‚Äô Lounge (2023)</a>; I know exactly why I work at the university and not at a school.</p>

			 <p>In continuation of week <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/01/14/what-caught-my.html">02</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the third week of 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>üñ®Ô∏è Almost 2 years after Anker introduced its V6 Color Engine for the <a href="https://www.ankermake.com/uk/m5">M5 3D printer</a>, it <a href="https://all3dp.com/4/ankermake-pulls-plug-on-v6-multicolor-add-on-to-refund-backers/">cancelled it</a>. You can either get a $600 discount for an as yet unannounced product, or they will refund the paid money. I&rsquo;ve opted for a $330 refund. Although it&rsquo;s a pity, I think it was the right decision for Anker to pull the plug on this product. My M5 already has problems with just one filament; getting the printer to work reliably with 6 print heads was probably indeed an unsolvable task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìö I had resolved to read more books this year. I have finished <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/01/15/finished-reading-die.html">one</a> so far, although I probably started it over ten months ago and have only now finally completed it. Instead of reading one of the countless hardcover books owned by my wife, I wanted to start with <em>Holly</em> as an eBook. But on the iPhone, despite Focus Modes etc., I get distracted far too easily, so I bought a <a href="https://pocketbook.de/de_en/pocketbook-era-stardust-silver">PocketBook Era</a> (with a 20% discount). With it, I will definitely manage to outwit myself ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>üíª As teased <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/01/14/what-caught-my.html">last week</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/screenfloat-screenshot-tools/id414528154?mt=12">ScreenFloat 2.0</a> was released. A ton of <a href="https://blog.eternalstorms.at/2024/01/17/get-to-know-screenfloat-2-part-i-an-overview/">new features</a> and even a free upgrade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üñ•Ô∏è In addition to all those great windows managers like <a href="https://manytricks.com/moom/">Moom</a>, <a href="https://rectangleapp.com">Rectangle</a>, <a href="https://thelasso.app">Lasso</a>, you name it, there is another (free) little utility: <a href="https://github.com/pablopunk/swiftshift">SwiftShift</a> - <em>Sweet window management for macOS</em>.</p>

<p>üêå This week was a rather slow one regarding new software I was looking into but in RL it was much more intense.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>‚ùÑÔ∏è Besides cancelled and new hardware and a couple of new apps, we had a few real winter days this week with temperatures down to -10 ¬∞C. Since this is quite unusual here, everyone was totally overwhelmed. There were storm warnings up to warnings of life-threatening conditions, people were advised to avoid driving, schools were closed, and public transportation was severely limited for two days. But the landscape was really beautiful, and the rounds with the dog were slippery but dreamy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚úä Moreover, in the last few weeks, there has finally been an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/19/turmoil-in-germany-over-neo-nazi-mass-deportation-meeting-explained">outcry</a> in Germany against the increasing number of Nazis in society and political parties. There were nationwide demonstrations with millions of people on the streets. Even in our small town, between 13,000 and 15,000 were demonstrating on the weekend. The march had already returned to the starting point, and yet not everyone had even started walking. It was absolutely impressive to see so many people absolutely peacefully demonstrating in freezing cold for human rights in the city center. Our two sons were also there, which made me somehow proud.</p>

			 <p>In continuation of week <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/01/07/what-caught-my.html">01</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the second week of 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>üèãÔ∏è After my <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2023/12/13/what-caught-my.html">Covid infection</a> in early December, followed by exhaustion, I started with a training program. It includes (indoor) cycling, strength training, and yoga sessions. It&rsquo;s exhausting, but it also feels good to finally be able to challenge my body a little again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìö Additionally, I wanted to read more, watch movies more regularly, meditate daily if possible, and do other nice little things more frequently. Therefore, I have started to enter these things as events in my calendar so that I don&rsquo;t lose sight of them.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The first week has already gone quite well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ü§ñ <a href="https://jb.heydingus.net/2024/01/12/i-just-updated.html">Jarod Blundy</a> released an excellent Shortcut on <a href="https://heydingus.net/shortcuts/generate-alt-text-with-openai-vision">HeyDingus</a>. It <em>automatically generates an image description using OpenAI‚Äôs GPT4</em>. And if this was not enough, he released <a href="https://heydingus.net/shortcuts/microblog-multimedia-uploader">Micro.blog Multimedia Uploader</a> - <em>upload any file to Micro.blog and format it for your blog post</em>. ü§©</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üîó <a href="https://norden.social/@czottmann/111742655994401539">Carlo</a> pointed to <a href="https://forum.actions.work/t/open-mastodon-thread-in-phanpys-excellent-thread-viewer/258">Phanpy&rsquo;s excellent Mastodon thread viewer</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üíª I really enjoy all the <a href="https://www.apptorium.com/apps">Apps</a> from Apptorium. Lots of great stuff available, mainly for macOS. They came up with a new app: <a href="https://www.apptorium.com/blog/cursor-teleporter">Cursor Teleporter</a> - <em>Teleport your cursor across your displays</em>. In my lectures, I often struggle with moving and finding the cursor on the projector behind me; this app helps a lot to avoid that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìù <a href="https://mas.to/@obsidian/111721992062128063">Obsidian</a> collected projects for its Gems of the Year 2023, and now the voting on their Discord has begun. Lots of interesting plugins. I already use some of them, but most were new to me. I voted for Carlos' <a href="https://actions.work/actions-for-obsidian">Actions for Obsidian</a>, among others, and installed <a href="https://github.com/xRyul/obsidian-image-converter">Image Converter</a>: <em>Convert and compress images from one format to another by drag&rsquo;n&rsquo;dropping or pasting files into the note</em>. I&rsquo;ve been looking for a plugin like this for a long time and created something similar myself with the help of Shortcuts and Retrobatch. But, this plugin is much more convenient and powerful. I also really like the <a href="https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter">linter</a> plugin - <em>an Obsidian plugin that formats and styles your notes with a focus on configurability and extensibility</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üîñ Furthermore, I have bookmarked the following plugins to possibly come back to them at the right time: <a href="https://tfthacker.com/canvas-candy">canvas candy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/trey-wallis/obsidian-dataloom">dataloom</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ivan-lednev/obsidian-day-planner">day planner</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-easy-bake">easy bake</a>, <a href="https://github.com/LostPaul/obsidian-folder-notes">folder notes</a>, <a href="https://davish.github.io/obsidian-full-calendar/">full calendar</a>, <a href="https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git">git</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban">kanban</a>, <a href="https://github.com/khoj-ai/khoj">khoj</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mProjectsCode/obsidian-meta-bind-plugin">meta bind</a>, <a href="https://github.com/danielo515/obsidian-modal-form">modal form</a>, <a href="https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite">latex suite</a>, <a href="https://github.com/andrewbrereton/obsidian-to-ical-plugin">obsidian to ical</a>, <a href="https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd">quickadd</a>, <a href="https://github.com/brianpetro/obsidian-smart-connections">smart connections</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/joshuatazrein/obsidian-time-ruler">time ruler</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ It was mentioned on the last episode of <a href="https://hemisphericviews.com">Hemispheric Views</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/idle-iktah/id1631764038"> Idle Iktah</a> - <em>Idle Iktah is an incremental</em> iOS <em>game set in a fictionalized Pacific Northwest where you start from nothing and create your own path to success</em>. It looks very strange. I downloaded it but have not started playing yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üïπÔ∏è I believe this one-dimensional Pac Man game that you can play in your browser was mentioned on DF<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>: <a href="https://abagames.github.io/crisp-game-lib-11-games/?pakupaku">Paku Paku</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üé• Max Handelman, the developer of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id6448645963">GameButler</a>, released <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id6475015890"> Minerva for Trakt</a> - <em>the movie and TV show app that you‚Äôve been looking for</em>. Yet another Trakt client. It has a similar, quite cool, aesthetic as GameButler (I would call it very functional) and no subscription model (just a small one-time payment). I still stick to <a href="https://tvforecastapp.com">TV Forecast</a> though, the only thing missing for me is the ability to sort my own watchlist by various criteria. (Which seems to be possible with Minerva.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üõ†Ô∏è <a href="https://eternalstorms.at">Eternalstorms</a> is another developer whose software I really like. I was a long-time user of Screenfloat before I replaced it with the corresponding function of <a href="https://cleanshot.com">CleanShot X</a> (also on <a href="https://setapp.com/apps/cleanshot">Setapp</a>). But I am still excited about <a href="https://blog.eternalstorms.at/2024/01/10/screenfloat-2-january-17-2024-somethings-up/">Version 2</a>, which will be released next week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìù Barebones released version 15 of <a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a>. I instantly upgraded before even reading the <a href="https://www.barebones.com/support/bbedit/notes-15.0.html">release notes</a>. Its <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/01/bbedit-15-adds-chatgpt-support/">main new feature</a> is ChatGPT worksheet support. <a href="https://isfeeling.social/@matt/111732443355317204">Matt</a> made a <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=G1zFWFzKRUI">video</a> about it, if you&rsquo;re interested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üé® Hiro posted these <a href="https://bylokki.gumroad.com/l/tewallaper">Teenage Engineering iPhone Wallpapers</a> in his weeknotes. I am not into sequencer stuff at all (unfortunately, I am completely talentless when it comes to music) but they look awesome, nevertheless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì∫ Started watching <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/slow-horses/seasons/3">Slow Horses S3</a>, <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/for-all-mankind/seasons/4">For All Mankind S4</a> and watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/movies/jiro-dreams-of-sushi-2011">Jiro Dreams of Sushi</a>.

<p>I had previously tried to write these things down as normal lists or tasks in Obsidian and other apps. But I didn&rsquo;t like that. Even specialized apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1639800794">RoutineFlow</a> were not the right tool for me.

			 <p>In continuation of week <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2023/12/31/what-caught-my.html">52</a>, 2023, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the first week of 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ü§î I read some blog posts about <a href="https://0xdstn.site/writing/without/">One Month Without</a> and I always find it interesting to see what people are willing to give up for a month. I did this spontaneously in the first half of 2023, giving up alcohol, caffeine (not entirely true, I did drink green tea a few times, but completely abstained from coffee, cola, etc.), sweets, and snacks. Giving up coffee was definitely the hardest. I have not yet decided if and for how long I will repeat it this year, but I have declared January to be alcohol-free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì± <a href="https://www.clicks.tech/">Clicks for iPhone</a> - <em>a REAL KEYBOARD for your iPhone</em>: tempting, and I still hate typing on my iPhone (sometimes I get the impression that Apple wants to annoy me on purpose, always choosing keys nearby and never those that lead to sensible words; the new LLM for autocorrect is also not yet available in German). But I wouldn&rsquo;t want to keep taking my phone out of the case (which I use most of the time), putting it into this keyboard and back into the case again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üñ•Ô∏è <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sindresorhus">Sindre</a> did it again and released a little utility for the Mac: <a href="https://sindresorhus.com/second-clock">Second Clock</a> - <em>Show a second clock for a different time zone in your menu bar</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üé® <a href="https://github.com/kevinhermawan/Canvas">A DALL¬∑E playground for the Mac</a>: I had not tried DALL-E before because I always assumed that you needed an OpenAI-plus subscription for it. For this app, you only need an API key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üïπÔ∏è <a href="https://malenfant.net/@didier/111685970411351670">Didier</a> posted about <a href="https://github.com/dirkwhoffmann/vAmiga">vAmiga</a> - <em>a user-friendly Amiga 500, 1000, 2000 emulator for macOS</em>. I have not tried it myself yet, but it looks great.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì∑ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/03/unknown-items-in-icloud-photos">Gruber</a> had a problem with unknown files in his Photo Library, and Caleb Hailey <a href="https://mastodon.social/@calebhailey/111653442283836729">helped</a> him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìö <a href="https://otavio.cc/2024/01/01/the-website-standard.html">Ot√°vio</a> posted a link to <a href="https://standardebooks.org">Standard Ebooks</a> - <em>a volunteer-driven project that produces new editions of public domain ebooks that are lovingly formatted, open source, free of U.S. copyright restrictions, and free of cost</em>. Oh well, if only I read more books &hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üíæ Speaking of Ot√°vio. He is the author of <a href="https://github.com/otaviocc/obsidian-microblog">Micro.publish</a>, an Obsidian plugin that lets you publish directly to <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a>. Love it. I ran across a bug trying to publish my last weeknote and he was so kind to fix right it away ü§©. (Ot√°vio even wrote a <a href="https://otavio.cc/2024/01/01/micropublish.html">blog post</a> about it.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üá©üá™ <a href="https://digitalcourage.social/@mjaschen/111685272251532868">Marcus</a> posted a link to <a href="https://gist.github.com/MarvinJWendt/2f4f4154b8ae218600eb091a5706b5f4">All German words (German wordlist)</a> - who knows what it might be useful for in the future; bookmarked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ Remakes I knew about, but I only just learned that there are also Demakes: <a href="https://github.com/lambertjamesd/portal64">Demake of Portal for the Nintendo 64</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üïπÔ∏è Downloaded <a href="https://crunchyroll.com/himesquest/">Crunchyroll Presents: Hime&rsquo;s Quest</a> for my Analogue Pocket - <em>Go back to 1999 and help Crunchyroll-Hime protect New Crunchy City from Y2K!</em> By the way, my Analogue Pocket Dock has arrived, which I should have ordered directly. ü•∞</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ I don&rsquo;t even want to know how much time this boy has spent playing Tetris on the NES to achieve this: <a href="https://kottke.org/24/01/13-year-old-becomes-first-to-beat-nes-tetris">13-Year-Old Becomes First to Beat NES Tetris</a>. I also wonder why a 13-year-old spends his free time in front of an NES and not playing Fortnite or Minecraft ü§£. And how crazy are these different <a href="https://kottke.org/21/05/new-nes-tetris-technique">playing techniques</a>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üê≠ I thought this would never happen: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24006670/mickey-mouse-steamboat-willie-enters-copyright-public-domain-2024">Welcome to the public domain, Mickey Mouse</a> - <em>Steamboat Willie finally slips out of copyright</em>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> As a result, you can now watch <a href="https://ledbetter-games.itch.io/steamboat-willie">Steamboat Willie</a> via <a href="https://hteumeuleu.itch.io/playorama">Playorama</a> on your <a href="https://play.date">Playdate</a>, if you want to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ü§î While <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2023/12/13/state-of-app.html">reviewing my subscriptions</a>, I had already considered canceling <a href="https://kagi.com">kagi</a>. <a href="https://nileane.fr/@nileane/111705532073853768">This</a> made it easier for me, although I am aware that probably every search engine at least tolerates unethical practices indirectly or even practices them directly to some extent. My hope is that if service providers realize that such non-technical aspects are also relevant to customers, they will hopefully take them more into account in future decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì∫ Finished Season 2 of <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/136315">The Bear</a> and <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/84958">Loki</a> - loved both.</p>

<p>üìù <a href="https://social.lol/@bw">Blake</a> released a web app for omg.lol: <a href="https://write.omg.lol/">write.omg.lol</a> - <em>A simple notepad in your browser backed by omg.lol&rsquo;s Pastebin feature</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üñ•Ô∏è Found this on <a href="https://baty.net/journal/2023/12/27/using-setapp-versions-of-apps">baty.net</a>: <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2019/04/22/so-you-got-setapp-dot-dot-dot-make-the-most-of-it/">So you got Setapp‚Ä¶ make the most of it</a>: A Terminal script, &ldquo;<em>which will tell you what apps you have that also have a Setapp version</em>&rdquo;.

<li>
<p>‚úèÔ∏è <a href="https://social.lol/@canion">Canion</a> posted about another nice-looking plain text/markdown note-taking app I had never heard of before: <a href="https://www.notebooksapp.com">Notebooks</a>. I now use <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> with its <a href="https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview">Dataview</a> plugin and <a href="https://actions.work/actions-for-obsidian">Actions for Obsidian</a> so intensively that I can&rsquo;t imagine switching, but in principle, native macOS/iOS apps of this kind are extremely welcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéµ Installed <a href="https://github.com/martinfekete10/Tuneful">Tuneful</a> - <em>a native macOS menu bar playback control app for Spotify and Apple Music</em>.</p>

<p>üïπ I checked out <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/resident-evil-4/id6462360082">‚ÄéResident Evil 4</a> on my M2 MacBook Pro and was pleasantly surprised at how well and smoothly it plays. I imagine I see clear differences to the PS5 version I already own, but if I didn&rsquo;t, it could have been a good purchase for the Mac as well. (I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s such a clever idea to sell games that have been available for established gaming consoles for years to &ldquo;real&rdquo; gamers, but I&rsquo;m keeping my fingers crossed for Apple.)</p>

<p>üéô I&rsquo;ve deleted Overcast and moved to Apple Podcasts.app. Just added only a few shows back in. I&rsquo;ll try to listen to less Podcasts at 1,0 x speed and more music.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìñ I read the countless annual reviews and outlooks<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> with great interest and was pleased about the (perceived) <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/the-web-is-fantastic/">renaissance of blogging</a>. Of course, a large part of this was due to <a href="https://defaults.rknight.me">Rob&rsquo;s App Defaults</a> overview page, which now offers &gt; 300 individual blogs as RSS feeds for simple import into your own feed reader.</p>

<p>üôè Thank you for reading my Weeknotes in 2023! I didn&rsquo;t quite manage to consistently follow through on the resolution I made at the beginning of the year to write down a few things each week, was briefly on the verge of <a href="https://esamecar.weblog.lol/2023/11/what-caught-my-attention-in-week-fourty-seven-2023">giving up</a> entirely, and still find it a bit odd, but I had a lot of fun with it. I registered with omg.lol at the beginning of 2023, moved my then only a few weeks old Mastodon account to social.lol, and became a member of micro.blog. I am very happy to have discovered this part of the net. I have actually gotten to know several people who have become dear to me, even though I do not know them personally. Thank you for that! It actually made the year 2023 better, although otherwise, it wasn&rsquo;t really a year I look back on with much joy. <strong>So, I wish everyone a Happy New Year, stay healthy, and see you soon. Looking forward to it!</strong></p>

			 <p>Due to my Covid infection, I was only able to publish my Weeknotes for week 49 quite late, so here are just a few more thoughts and things that caught my attention in week 50, 2023:</p>

<p>üí∂ I published my <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2023/12/13/state-of-app.html">State of App and Services Subscriptions 2023</a> and read similar posts from other people with great interest.</p>

<p>ü§ñ <a href="https://lmstudio.ai/">LM Studio</a> - <em>Discover, download, and run local LLMs</em>: It feels like the AI hype has significantly flattened, but of course, chatbots are here to stay. The possibility of running them locally on your computer is naturally tempting. Bookmarked.</p>

<li>
<p>I love <a href="https://hyperkey.app">Hyperkey</a> and therefore started evaluating <a href="https://superkey.app">Superkey</a>. I am not sure yet if I will use its added functionality but it would be a way to support <a href="https://ryanhanson.dev">Ryan&rsquo;s</a> work nevertheless.</p>

But now it&rsquo;s up an running again. üòÖ</p>

<li>üü¢ <a href="http://1password.com">1Password</a>: <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2023/12/13/what-caught-my.html">Until last week</a>, my standard password manager. I am currently considering whether it could potentially be replaced by Apple&rsquo;s Keychain; however, I am not fully there yet.</li>
<li>üü¢ <a href="http://anybox.app">Anybox</a>: My current bookmark manager of choice; I could possibly live with the free version of <a href="https://raindrop.io">Raindrop.io</a>; but even though the developer probably <a href="https://nitter.net/raindrop_io/status/1550785806796742656">no longer lives</a> in Russia, the <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/when-war-in-ukraine-influences-my-application-choices/">proximity</a> is somehow still too uncomfortable for me.</li>
<li>üü¢ <a href="https://www.arqbackup.com">Arq</a>: I use Arq since 2016 together with the countless TB of free OneDrive storage space available to me as part of the MS Office subscription; I couldn&rsquo;t sleep peacefully without offsite backup.</li>
<li>üü¢ <a href="https://chroniclingapp.com">Chronicling</a>: I use it a lot lately, especially to fill my Daily Journal in Obsidian via Shortcuts.app; I really don&rsquo;t want to miss it.</li>
<li>üü° <a href="https://dayoneapp.com">DayOne</a>: Since I moved my Daily Journal to Obsidian in the middle of the year, I don&rsquo;t really use it anymore. But I still let it be filled (automatically). My first entries go back to the year 2008, although I can&rsquo;t figure out when it was actually published. Would feel strange without it.</li>
<li>üü¢ <a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a>: I used the app extensively in the past, then didn&rsquo;t understand it for a long time, and currently, I can&rsquo;t imagine life without it again.</li>
<li>üü¢ <a href="https://www.epicrideweather.com">Epic Weather Ride</a>: An indispensable weather tool for planning bike tours.</li>
<li>üî¥ <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/fddb-kalorienz%C3%A4hler-di%C3%A4t/id1105332761">FDDB</a>: I regularly fail to track my calories consistently and thus control my weight. Most of the year an unused app because it is too exhausting to constantly weigh your food. I should cancel and only resubscribe when I really (for a month or two) want to use it.</li>
<li>üü¢ <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/healthfit/id1202650514">HealthFit</a>: One of the few ways to get .fit files from the <a href="https://www.hammerhead.io">Hammerhead Karoo 2</a> into Apple Health and much more. Subscription is even voluntary and IMHO extremely well invested.</li>
<li>üü° <a href="http://iconnecthue.com">iConnectHue</a>: An alternative way to program and control Philips Hue lamps. In the past, the things I wanted to implement could only be set up properly through it. However, I should take a look during the brighter time of the year to see if most of it can now also be done via the native app.</li>
<li>üü° <a href="http://ifttt.com">ifttt</a>: Oh, I actually only use it to import various things into Day One automatically. I don&rsquo;t really need it but I love automating things ü§î.</li>
<li>üü¢ <a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/">Ivory</a>: There are a number of alternative Mastodon clients like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mona-for-mastodon/id1659154653">Mona</a> etc. that do not rely on a subscription; also, the development speed is not very high at the moment. On the other hand, I&rsquo;ve gotten very used to these very polished apps for iOS and macOS.</li>
<li>üü° <a href="http://kagi.com">Kagi</a>: A really good Google alternative. But ultimately &ldquo;only&rdquo; for the conscience. It&rsquo;s not that I achieve anything with Kagi that wouldn&rsquo;t be possible with google.com or <a href="http://duckduckgo.com">duckduckgo</a>.</li>
<li>üî¥ <a href="https://upaheadapp.com">Up Ahead</a>: Incredible nice-looking app, but I feel like it hasn&rsquo;t been updated for almost a year now. (How nice it would be if you could simply add  entries from the calendar.) It&rsquo;s hard, but</li>
<li>üü¢ <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mastodon">Mastodon</a>: Completely voluntary and actually too small an amount.</li>
<li>üî¥ <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mercury-weather/id1621800675">Mercury Weather</a>: I really like it, it has even won big at the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2023-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/">MacStories Selects</a>, but since I rarely travel to other places/countries and the Weather app is also getting better&hellip;</li>
<li>üü¢ <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> : What can I say &hellip;</li>
<li>üî¥ <a href="https://www.mindnode.com">Mindnode</a>: Used to be one of my most used apps; it is now also available via Setapp and I only have the subscription because of the iOS version; however, I use the latter very rarely ATM.</li>
<li>üü° MS Office 365: In the meantime, my sons through school as well as my wife and I through work theoretically have free access to Office at home, however, I paid for several years in advance a long time ago and now the subscription just runs. I use the storage space intensively with Arq (see above); I should check at some point whether it can be realized more cheaply.</li>
<li>üü¢ <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/neptunes/id1006739057?mt=12">Neptunes</a>: Costs almost nothing and I use it daily on the Mac.</li>
<li>üü¢ <a href="https://nordvpn.com/">NordVPN</a>: Everyone should have a VPN service, right?</li>
<li>üü¢ <a href="https://obsidian.md/sync">Obsidian Sync</a>: Without Obsidian, my computer life would be meaningless right now. There would be alternatives to synchronize the content between platforms, but the Sync subscription is a good way to support Obsidian in its entirety.</li>
<li>üî¥ <a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast Premium</a>: I never understood the UI concept of Overcast. However, it has Shortcuts support and I have automated a few things with it. Are they really necessary? No.</li>
<li>üî¥ <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/personal-best-workouts/id1510256676">Personal Best</a>: Nice, but the UI is still a bit too confusing for me and the actual benefit may be too small.</li>
<li>üü° <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/play-save-videos-watch-later/id1596506190">Play</a>: I&rsquo;ll take a look at it again in a year. Right now, I really enjoy the channels feature <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/play-2-0-adds-youtube-channel-support-folders-and-a-new-premium-subscription/">introduced in 2.0</a>.</li>
<li>üî¥ <a href="https://www.pixelmator.com/photomator/">Photomator</a>: Great app, but I don&rsquo;t use it often enough.</li>
<li>üü° <a href="https://readwise.io/read">Reader Readwise</a>: The price is at the upper limit of pain for me but only thanks to an educational discount. I use the app very extensively; if it were more expensive, I would switch to <a href="http://omnivore.app">Omnivore</a>.</li>
<li>üü¢ <a href="https://setapp.com/de">Setapp</a>: Worth the money thanks to the Edu discount.</li>
<li>üî¥ <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/s%C3%B6ka-bucket-lists-made-easy/id6446223795">S√∂ka</a>: I like it. I travel too little to really take advantage of it. Maybe I&rsquo;ll subscribe for a month or so before the next vacation?</li>
<li>üü° <a href="https://timeryapp.com">Timery</a>: I use it professionally, but I pay for it privately because it helps me keep a little better track.</li>
<li>üü° <a href="https://trakt.tv/vip">trakt.tv</a>: Actually, I watch too few series to justify a VIP account. But in this way, things can be automated very nicely and transferred to Day One via IFTT, etc. Oh &hellip;</li>
<li>üî¥ <a href="https://trainingtodayapp.com">Training Today</a>: After the app once attested to me the best fitness despite fever and malaise, I believe it is just an (expensive) random number generator.</li>
<li>üü¢ <a href="https://tvforecastapp.com">TV Forecast</a>: I love this app.</li>
<li><a href="https://waterllama.com">Waterllama</a>: I have now bought a Live Time license.</li>
<li>üü¢ <a href="https://www.ynab.com">YNAB</a>: Without YNAB, we would be heavily in debt, I would have even more pointless stuff, and my wife would have left me with the kids and dog.</li>
<li>üü° <a href="https://manuelkehl.com/apps/zenitizer/">Zenitizer</a>: The subscription reminds me that I damn well need to work on overcoming my inner laziness more regularly.</li>
<li>üü¢ Apple One Premium: As a family, we need a large iCloud storage tier just for the photos. In addition, we use Apple Music and Apple TV+. In total, still more expensive than Premium. It&rsquo;s a pity, really.</li>
<li>üü¢ Disney+: Marvel, Star Wars, etc. - we can&rsquo;t do without it.</li>
<li>üü° <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Nintendo-Switch-Online/Benefits/Benefits-2060569.html">Nintendo Switch Online</a>: Necessary just for my son&rsquo;s ZELDA backup, although üòà &hellip;</li>
<li>üü° <a href="https://www.playstation.com/ps-plus/">PlayStationPlus</a>: If I could understand what exactly happens to my 300 previously &ldquo;acquired&rdquo; games through it if I were to cancel it, it might even be conceivable to do so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</li>
<li>üü¢ <a href="https://uk.wahoofitness.com/wahoo-x-membership">wahoo X</a>: The Zwift UI has too negative an impact on my blood pressure; I have therefore been looking for a long time for an alternative to indoor cycling that just works reliably. The Sufferfest / wahoo SYSTM does this. My way of exercising in the winter months.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, there are a few programs / services that I have now canceled as a result. I still have to think about the other üü° apps. It would probably be wise to cancel them as well and after the subscription expires, see if I can bear their loss and if not, just resubscribe.</p>
<p>But basically, nice things cost money and all these services and apps make my day easier or enrich my life. At least now I know where I stand at the moment. üòÄ</p>
<p>P.S. I totally forgot to include <a href="https://home.omg.lol">omg.lol</a>, my <a href="https://posteo.de/en">e-mail provider</a>, and Hemispheric Views' One Prime Plus, but those are all no-brainers for me. üòÖ</p>
<p>P.P.S: This list only covers tech related stuff. Charity and other related expenses are not listed here.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2023/12/13/what-caught-my.html">What caught my attention in week fourty-nine, 2023</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2023/12/13/what-caught-my.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-12-13 12:18:39 &#43;0100">Dec 13, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In continuation of week <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2023/12/03/what-caught-my.html">48</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in week 49, 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ü¶† Yes, I had already feared it, and unfortunately, it happened: My wife&rsquo;s Covid-19 infection did not pass me by. Therefore, my weeknote is regrettably appearing a little too late &ldquo;this week.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üî´ You may not necessarily like the content, but technically, the <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QdBZY2fkU-0">trailer for GTA VI</a> definitely blew me away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚úèÔ∏è Another PDF editor that I will look at in my long search for an alternative to Preview<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> is <a href="https://www.pdfgear.com">PDFgear</a> - <em>PDF Tasks Made Easy.</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ü™ü <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/05/an-applescript-for-safari-split-tabs-to-new-window">Gruber released</a> <em>An AppleScript for Safari to move all tabs in the frontmost window, from the current tab to the rightmost (last) tab, to a new window</em>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/gruber/eb89728474ba59287df79c054e1097a5">Split Tabs to New Window.scpt</a>. But even better is <a href="https://mastodon.social/@jackwellborn/111539651190313429">the tip</a> from <a href="https://mastodon.social/@jackwellborn">Jack Wellborn</a>, that you can easily drag and drop multiple tabs into a new window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìù I have been doing most of my (transformative) text work with BBEdit for decades. I really wouldn‚Äôt know what to do with my life without Multi-File Search and Regex, but sometimes I also like to use <a href="https://retina.studio/textbuddy/">TextBuddy</a> or <a href="https://www.gtrigonakis.com/textworkflow">Text Workflow</a>. Another nice app that does something similar is by <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@chrishannah">Chris Hannah</a> and now apparently even free for iOS and macOS: <a href="https://textcase.app">Text Case</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üìù While I&rsquo;m on the topic of text editors. <a href="https://coteditor.com">CotEditor</a> now also has a Quick Action Bar - if only the programs could agree on a uniform shortcut!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üïπ For the 30th anniversary of Doom, I <a href="https://www.gog.com/de/game/doom_1993">bought it again</a> and immediately installed it <a href="https://www.paulfioravanti.com/blog/classic-doom-mac/">on my MacBook</a> and <a href="https://github.com/OnionUI/Ports-Collection">Miyoo mini plus</a>. In keeping with this, John Romero released <a href="https://romero.com/sigil">SIGIL II</a>. Speaking of Miyoo mini plus - there is now a <a href="https://github.com/XK9274/pico-8-wrapper-miyoo">native pico-8 wrapper</a>, too ü•≥.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üëæ I started playing <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0301905/">Super Mario Advance</a> (GBA) on my Analogue Pocket. I noticed that I definitely never played Super Mario Bros. 2 before. (I could have sworn that I had at least tried all the major releases.) You can tell that the second part is a reskin and somehow it doesn&rsquo;t really fit into the series. I also find it absurdly difficult already in the third / fourth world. Let&rsquo;s see how far I will get in the game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéÆ I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a coincidence or due to the recently released firmware updates, but lately my Playstation Portal has been running absolutely smoothly ü•∞</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üßµ Unfortunately, I now have to crawl out of <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/110667962169426329">my European library</a> again, because soon <a href="https://www.threads.net">the fun begins here too</a>! (However, I will continue to ignore Threads, just like Facebook and Instagram, for the time being.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÜîÔ∏è In terms of features, it&rsquo;s not yet an alternative to Kaleidoscope, but it&rsquo;s affordable: <a href="https://proxymanstore.gumroad.com/l/textdiffer">Text Differ</a> - <em>Meet Text Differ, a native macOS app that shows beautiful differences between 2 texts.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéô Lately, I was a little annoyed by the ever-same content in my overflowing podcast subscription list. I think I will actually export all my subscribed podcasts, delete Overcast, and in Apple Podcasts, subscribe to <a href="https://ruminatepodcast.com">Ruminate</a> and <a href="https://hemisphericviews.com">Hemispheric Views</a>, and then consider whether and which <a href="https://flamedfury.com/posts/my-podcast-rotation-keeping-it-at-four/">other two</a> of the usual suspects I choose. Also, I <a href="https://rknight.me/smart-speed-broke-my-brain/">followed Robb&rsquo;s advice</a> and turned off Smart Speed and reset the playback speed to 1.0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üõë I have now forbidden 1Password on all my devices from wanting to fill anything anywhere and only use it as a (backup) vault. I have exported all my passwords from 1PW into the Apple Keychain<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, and my life has become significantly less annoying. I&rsquo;m going to look at this for a few weeks now and then consider whether I completely get rid of 1PW or keep it running alongside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üñäÔ∏è iOS 17.2 was released, and with it the Journal.app. I can&rsquo;t do anything with the app itself, but <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/blog/introducing-journaling-suggestions/">DayOne is allowed to use the same API</a> and can suggest the same things. That&rsquo;s cool!<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚åö watchOS 10.2 has brought back the ability to change Watch Faces by simple swiping. Thank you, Apple! I had to search for quite a while until I finally understood that this setting can only be made on the watch itself: <code>Settings &gt; Clock &gt; Swipe to Switch Watch Face</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>In the past, I have suffered significant data loss after annotating PDFs with Preview.app, and since then, I no longer trust the application. Thank you, Apple.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>However, I have not yet really understood their monetization concept.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Of course, Safari crashed immediately during import; whoever is responsible for software quality at Apple, in my opinion, should be fired.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:4" role="doc-endnote">
<p>At the moment, I primarily keep my Daily Journal in Obsidian but transfer a copy of it to Day One via Shortcuts.app; I need to rethink my use of Day One separately.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			<h1><a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2023/12/03/what-caught-my.html">What caught my attention in week fourty-eight, 2023</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2023/12/03/what-caught-my.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-12-03 17:15:20 &#43;0100">Dec 3, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In continuation to week <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2023/11/26/what-caught-my.html">47</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in week 48, 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ü¶† My wife was plagued at the beginning of the week with severe headaches and especially nausea. The Corona test was negative. However, on Friday it turned out that she did have Corona, for the first time (proven) since the beginning of the pandemic. She is now slowly getting better, but it has really knocked her down. Let&rsquo;s hope the children remain spared, who have already had it several times, though. Now I am the last one in the house on whom the virus has not yet shown up on a rapid test. Let&rsquo;s see how much longer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Somehow I can&rsquo;t decide right now whether I should publish my weeknotes in full length on <a href="https://blog.esamecar.net">weblog.lol</a> or <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net">micro.blog</a>. So far, I have done it on weblog.lol and only created the shorter posts on micro.blog<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. But there are so many nice tools like <a href="https://github.com/otaviocc/obsidian-microblog">Micro Publish</a>, <a href="https://redsweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>, and <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a> to publish directly on mb. I&rsquo;ll just put the post on both platforms for now and think about how I will handle this in the future by next week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚úèÔ∏è Speaking of <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a>, a really great editor that I use far too <a href="https://social.lol/@esamecar/111506814371408216">infrequently</a>, was just released in <a href="https://ia.net/topics/ia-writer-7">Version 7</a>. It has a very interesting approach regarding &ldquo;citing&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> in Markdown files<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. There is also a <a href="https://forum.obsidian.md/t/support-markdown-annotations-a-la-ia-writer-7/">call</a> to implement the syntax extension in Obsidian.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üéô And speaking of omg.lol. The <a href="https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/099">last episode</a> of <a href="https://listen.hemisphericviews.com">Hemispheric Views</a> was not as absurdly funny as the <a href="https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097">App Defaults</a> episode, but <a href="https://social.lol/@adam">Adam</a> was a guest. I always find it very interesting to hear what he has to say and am looking forward to his <a href="https://home.omg.lol/advent">25 days of omg.lol</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üñ•Ô∏è This week at <a href="https://indieappsanta.com">Indie App Santa</a>, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MacWhisper<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, probably the best-known Whisper client, was available for free. With <a href="https://www.bjnortier.com/2023/11/17/Hello-Transcribe-3.2.html">Hello Transcribe</a>, there seems to be an alternative that I have not yet tried myself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üñ•Ô∏è Also using LLM, but not for transcription, rather for translation, is <a href="https://github.com/tisfeng/Easydict">Easydict</a>: <em>Easydict is a concise and easy-to-use translation dictionary macOS App that allows you to easily and elegantly look up words or translate text.</em> It supports a bunch of different services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üë®‚Äçüíª I started evaluating <a href="https://wouter01.github.io/MediaMate/">MediaMate</a>: <em>Fresh visuals for Volume, Brightness, and Now Playing</em>. It has a nice Notch UI for now playing. Have not tested how it plays together with <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/notchmeister/id1599169747?mt=12">Notchmeister</a>, though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üïπ Started playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stray_%28video_game%29">Stray</a>. It is a welcome, quite peaceful change after the 100+ hours fighting as <a href="https://www.playstation.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west/">Aloy</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üïπ This week, I actually finished my first Mario game: <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_Bros._Deluxe">Super Mario Bros. Deluxe</a> (GBC). I played the cartridge on my <a href="https://www.analogue.co/pocket">Analogue Pocket</a> and thanks to Save States, I have finally managed to see the end credit scene. With every other Mario, I gave up along the way at some point, even though I probably started them all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üïπ There are not only seemingly 23,342 different retro handhelds, but at least 42 new ones are added every week. I had not heard of the <a href="https://evercade.co.uk/exp/">Evercade EXP</a> until now. You cannot play copies of your own ROMs or original cartridges here, but classics are reissued as cartridges for this system. Interesting concept, and there&rsquo;s even <a href="https://evercade.co.uk/cartridges/duke-nukem-collection-1/">Duke Nukem</a>!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üë∞ I found it interesting to read how much <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/01/fake-iphone-computational-photography-glitch">fuss</a> was made about this one <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/11/30/a-bride-to-be-discovers-a-reality-bending-mistake-in-apples-computational-photography">bride photo</a>. But probably because we no longer know or can assess what is real at all. I always wonder how my children are supposed to learn which statements in the form of a photo, a video, or an audio recording they can still trust. But that might also be the reason why many people only dive into their own filter bubble and generally dismiss everything as fake news that is too complicated for them or contradicts their own ideas and blindly believe what they want to believe. This is probably actually the biggest challenge we as a society are facing right now, alongside the climate crisis of course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üë± Speaking of audio recordings, I couldn&rsquo;t resist having my iPhone create <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/104993">my own voice</a>. I dutifully read aloud 150 sentences in English. At the beginning, I thought it would never end, but it went quickly towards the end. My iPhone then calculated a lot overnight and the next day I was allowed to try it out. The voice definitely sounds like me. But for my taste, it is significantly too slow. I don&rsquo;t know if this is generally the case or because I tried to speak as clearly as possible in a foreign language. How do people find it whose mother tongue is English? (I generally find it strange to hear my own voice, which of course makes the whole thing even more absurd.)</p>
</li>

<p>üîë I really need to reconsider my password strategy. 1Password and Apple&rsquo;s Keychain just don&rsquo;t cooperate well anymore on my systems, especially when Passkeys are involved. Autofill with 1Password is frequently broken, and you can&rsquo;t have both enabled. Perhaps I should designate my 1Password vault as the master (or as a backup?)  and save duplicates in Keychain to use for autofill. I&rsquo;m really unsure. I feels strange to have all my passwords in two separate &ldquo;clouds&rdquo;.</p>

<p>üì∫ Even though the subscription price is personally a little too high for me, because I&rsquo;m actually trying to reduce subscription costs, I signed up for the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/play-save-videos-watch-later/id1596506190">Play</a> 2.0 trial. I really like the new channel features and together with <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/vinegar-tube-cleaner/id1591303229">Vinegar</a>, it helps me get over paying 24 ‚Ç¨ a month for a Youtube Prime Family subscription, which is actually way too expensive for my taste.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üì∫ I&rsquo;m really looking forward to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5875444/episodes/?season=3">Slow Horses Season 3</a>, but before that, I want to finish <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14452776/">The Bear</a> with my wife. Then there&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9140554/episodes/?season=2&amp;ref_=tt_eps_sn_2">Loki S2</a> and the new season of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7772588/episodes/?season=4&amp;ref_=tt_eps_sn_4">For All Mankind S4</a> waiting.

<p>Micro.blog is a service for which I have a kind of love-hate relationship (although this is greatly exaggerated). I want to love the service, and Manton seems to be a really nice person; the community and idea are also great. However, I always feel like mb is so fragile that you only have to look at it sideways for it to fall apart. Something is always not working and it seems very oddly cobbled together. It&rsquo;s supposed to be a simple service but often it ends up being totally complicated and confusing. I never know if I&rsquo;m just too stupid to tick the right boxes, or if I&rsquo;ve stumbled upon another bug again.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			 <p>I just realized that I&rsquo;m slowly getting old and tired. In the past, I knew at least a little bit about every (Apple) thing. Nowadays, I&rsquo;ve lost track and have no desire to understand whether I can simply integrate Matter devices into my existing Homekit setup or if I need to make some fundamental changes and then everything implodes. I&rsquo;d rather not touch anything and just let it continue as it is. And what is this RCS? Does it also run on mobile data or does the provider charge a fee for each message, like for an SMS? And if so, why does anyone believe that it could somehow be an alternative to WhatsApp? And these passkeys; is there really no way to copy them from Keychain to 1Password or vice versa? Do I have to think in advance about how and where to save them? Seriously? Then I&rsquo;d rather stick with conventional passwords. Oh man ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

			 <p>You can do so much fun stuff with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Obsidian<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dataview<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I added notes for all of my electronic gear and based on properties for purchase date and price an inline dataview calculates the costs per week for each item, every time the note is opened ü§©</p>
<p>This is the actual inline calculation for cost/week:</p>
<p><code>=round(number(replace(this.preis,&quot;,&quot;,&quot;.&quot;)) / number(durationformat(dur(date(now) - this.kaufdatum),&quot;w&quot;)),2)</code></p>
<p>with<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ul>
<li><code>preis</code>: price property; as I am located in GER I use a textfield with an entry like &ldquo;42,99 ‚Ç¨&rdquo;; therefore the replacement of &ldquo;,&rdquo; by &ldquo;.&rdquo; and conversion to a number<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><code>kaufdatum</code>: purchase date property</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="update-2023-12-05">Update 2023-12-05</h3>
<p>Here is a slightly improved version of the inline field:</p>
<p><code>=replace(string(round(number(replace(this.preis,&quot;,&quot;,&quot;.&quot;)) / number(durationformat(dur(default(this.nutzung_bis, date(now)) - this.kaufdatum),&quot;w&quot;)),2)),&quot;.&quot;,&quot;,&quot;)</code></p>
<p>with<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ul>
<li><code>nutzung_bis</code>: a properties date field that marks the end of usage; the cost is calculated either until this date or if it is missing until today</li>
</ul>
<p>and it changes the ENG decimal point back to the GER &ldquo;,&rdquo;</p>

			 <p><a href="https://social.lol/@lubieniebieski">Adam</a> told me to <a href="https://social.lol/@lubieniebieski/111416411270482033">stay on the path</a>, so I&rsquo;m trying to motivate myself to get back into the <a href="https://blog.esamecar.net/week">habit of writing</a> down what has interested me throughout the week. So, here comes week 47.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>üéÆ I finished playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_Forbidden_West">Horizon Forbidden West</a>. It was my first computer game in years, and probably the first AAA title in decades that I actually watched the end credits for. Usually, I start playing and then eventually stop. (Why should it be any different with video games than with other areas of my life?) I invested over 100 hours into Forbidden West, and whether or not that was a waste of time is for each person to decide, but I had a lot of fun. Over the past two weeks, I used the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/playstation-portal-remote-player/">Playstation Portal</a>. This accessory for the PS5 is essentially just a (pretty good, but unfortunately not OLED) screen with a built-in, very good controller - nothing more and nothing less. It allows me to play on the couch in the living room while my wife watches one of her shows. (My wife doesn&rsquo;t like me playing games on the TV in the living room when she&rsquo;s present.) <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/playstation-portal-early-review/">The Portal suffers</a> from the same weaknesses as Playstation&rsquo;s Remote Play itself: even with very good Wi-Fi coverage and the PS5 connected to the router with a cable (and <a href="https://heydingus.net/blog/2023/11/playstation-ethernet-connection">properly configured</a>), there are regular artifacts, slow downs, and sometimes even stuttering. I really hope that Sony gives its Remote Play implementation a little bit more attention and love now that they sell a dedicated device for this feature. But ultimately, I&rsquo;m quite satisfied, and the hardware is really well-made. (The lack of Bluetooth support doesn&rsquo;t bother me at all; I wouldn&rsquo;t want to constantly pair BT headphones anyway, and I actually have some very good headphones with a headphone jack that are happy to have found a new use.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üëæ Recently, my <a href="https://powkiddy.com/products/pre-sale-powkiddy-rgb30-rk3566-handheld-game-console-built-in-wifi">Powkiddy RGB30</a> also arrived. The handheld device was highly praised by a bunch of youtubers  and the 1:1 screen is really great for GB, GBA, and GBC games. I also really like <a href="https://github.com/JustEnoughLinuxOS/distribution/releases">JELOS</a>. HOWEVER, the hardware quality and customer service of this device and this company are extremely poor. The device arrived defective, with a stuck shoulder button. I had to contact Powkiddy multiple times to get a response. They casually suggested that I could try opening it up. Opening up a device that is only a few days old, still under warranty, with a spatula and screwdriver is not exactly what I had in mind. I actually managed to open the case and free the button without causing major damage to the device. Shortly after, another shoulder button got stuck, and then the first one again. And if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, the card slot eject mechanism also broke. All within one week. I really don&rsquo;t feel like having to dismantle the device every two days just to play a game for a few minutes. Powkiddy mentioned that I could send the device back to China at my own expense and then get a refund - yeah, right. Never ever again! üò°</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üëæ Speaking of retro gaming, while setting up the RGB30, I stumbled upon the <a href="https://lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">pico-8</a> Fantasy Console and was immediately impressed. I wasn&rsquo;t aware of the extent of this community. There are so many nice games, and almost all of them are free. You can play them on macOS, a variety of other operating systems, and even on retro handhelds. And as if that weren&rsquo;t enough, there&rsquo;s also the <a href="https://tic80.com">TIC-80</a>. Oh boy!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üñ•Ô∏è During the Black Week, or whatever this discount rally is called, I made my way through the impressive list of over 400 apps for macOS and iOS in the <a href="https://app.indieappsales.com">Indie App Sales</a> 2023. Fortunately, I already own the ones that interest me most and &ldquo;only&rdquo; bought three additional small apps this year:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spin-the-wheel-pick-me/id1523238520">Spin the Wheel - Pick Me</a>¬†(iPadOS)</li>
<li><a href="https://candies-jam-92d.craft.me/MSXtqHo7c0lP3E">NowPlaying - Liner Notes</a>¬†(iOS)</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1515445551?pt=121118333&amp;ct=IndieAppSales&amp;mt=8">Pi-hole Remote</a>¬†(macOS, iOS, iPadOS)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nevertheless, it‚Äôs an impressive list that also includes many Mastodon developer accounts that I didn‚Äôt know about before. Definitely worth looking into.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üñ•Ô∏è I also noticed¬†<a href="https://unclutterapp.com/bundle/?coupon=DFX-BLACKFRIDAY-2023">the Apps</a>¬†campaign: 10 applications for you and your Mac. It really only lists great apps. And even though I use¬†<a href="https://manytricks.com/moom/">Moom</a>, I&rsquo;ve bought a single Mac license of <a href="https://thelasso.app">Lasso</a> and both play quite nicely together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚å®Ô∏è  <a href="https://obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html">Launchbar</a>, the launcher I&rsquo;ve been using on macOS for almost 10 years, recently had noticeable delays when launching. It was impressive how my muscle memory was trained to expect to be able to perform actions immediately after pressing cmd+space. It was so bad, I took a look at <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a> and <a href="https://www.raycast.com">Raycast</a> again, but thanks to the nightly build Version 6.18.5 nightly (6247), everything is back to how I&rsquo;m used to it üòÖ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üòç Oh, and definitely not to be left unmentioned is this insanely awesome <a href="https://defaults.rknight.me/">App Defaults movement</a> that <a href="https://social.lol/@robb">Robb</a> unintentionally kicked off and wonderfully shows off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üëñ Furthermore, I enjoyed &ldquo;the <a href="https://mstdn.social/@yurnidiot/111451042954144680">walkthrough</a> explaining the inner workings of the ship that made the kessel run in less than 12 parsecs&rdquo;, saved <a href="https://asciiflow.com/#/">ASCIIFlow</a> in my bookmarks, and <a href="https://social.lol/@muhh/111465755801912892">pants</a> whose pockets may not be worn out by the phone after a few months.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been using Apple products for almost 18 years now. I adore their hardware and used to be a big fan of their software ecosystem. However, the software quality has plummeted lately, to the point where I&rsquo;ve decided not to buy any new Apple products for the time being.</p>
<p><strong>Because it just does not work</strong> (reliably).</p>
<p>I will continue using the devices I already have, and I do have quite a few. But I will actively resist the urge to acquire new flashy products from Cupertino until I feel that Apple gets its act together again.</p>
<p>Here are just a few random examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>My new Airpods Pro (2nd Gen) just do not appear in Find My.</li>
<li>The for us essential Screen Time feature often doesn&rsquo;t work at all on my youngest son&rsquo;s iPhone.</li>
<li>Both of my Macs often lose all their entries in System Settings / Accessibility, rendering a bunch of apps useless until I manually add them back in.</li>
<li>System Settings itself are a nightmare.</li>
<li>Messages ALWAYS informs me that my son has enabled &ldquo;do not disturb mode,&rdquo; preventing him from receiving incoming messages. Of course, that is not true at all.</li>
<li>Screen Time requests from my son show up in a group chat with him and my wife. I have to delete all messages daily in that chat because the Screen Time messages make the thread unresponsive. It even crashes on macOS. So, the chat becomes unusable for communication. We have to use another app - WTF?</li>
<li>Preview under macOS loses text notes for annotations I&rsquo;ve made after saving a PDF. This is a complete showstopper for the entire app. Data loss should be unacceptable.</li>
<li>My Home Pod mini in the kitchen often forgets timers. This really makes me happy during cooking.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t even get me started on the general reliability of Siri.</li>
<li>Recently, I discovered that many files do not appear in Spotlight search. It&rsquo;s frustrating when I know a file is there, but it simply cannot be found. This is almost as bad as data loss.</li>
<li>And then there all those little bugs I just ignore on a daily basis. There are definitely enough to start a &ldquo;a bug a day&rdquo; series &hellip;</li>
</ol>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t yet been to many different countries. That&rsquo;s mainly because my wife and I decided two decades ago to avoid cars and planes for traveling.

</ul>
</li>
<li>üéôÔ∏è This was my <strong>first episode of <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Launched/109744688589490094">Launched</a></strong>. It was a rather intimate podcast. And both the developers of the <a href="https://darknoise.app">Darknoise</a> app and <a href="https://sofahq.com">Sofa</a> seem to be very nice people. After what they said about <strong>software subscriptions</strong>, I&rsquo;m afraid that sooner or later all apps will have to switch to the subscription model. I personally don&rsquo;t like that, but if there&rsquo;s no other way for indie developers, you probably have to think about what you&rsquo;re willing to spend per year and then keep an eye on your subscriptions, e.g. with <a href="https://bobbyapp.co">Bobby</a>, and limit them accordingly.</li>
<li>üõãÔ∏è Speaking of <a href="https://sofahq.com">Sofa</a>. I really like the app, but I think I&rsquo;ll try to stay away from software and services where it&rsquo;s not possible to get your data out again with open standards, an API or at least an RSS feed.</li>
<li>ü´∞ Speaking of subscriptions, after all this <a href="https://mas.to/@dcrainmaker/109761992004211636">back and forth</a>, I <strong>cancelled my Strava subscription</strong>. I&rsquo;ll see if I can enjoy cycling without all their pro features.</li>
<li>üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Speaking of (I know, I know &hellip;) cycling, once again I have felt annoyed, no, <strong>threatened by SUV</strong> drivers. I really don&rsquo;t know where all this is going. Fittingly, the <a href="https://indieweb.social/@magalhini/109739198359436268">post</a> about the size of cars.</li>
<li>üêò I had a look at <strong><a href="https://social.shadowfacts.net/objects/25db7fa3-31e5-46aa-a534-643de7617f8e">Tusker</a></strong>, a new iOS Mastodon client. It&rsquo;s still fun to see all these many ideas for Mastodon clients. There hasn&rsquo;t been so much dynamism in the scene for a long time. Even though <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ice-cubes-for-mastodon/id6444915884">IceCube</a> gets a lot of praise, I keep coming back to <a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/">Ivory</a>, which was finally released in the App Store this week. You can only have missed it, though, if you&rsquo;ve been living under a rock. Even though I find the development speed of IceCube absolutely remarkable and the app is certainly one of the most impressive in terms of features, I am still bothered by the many small bugs and especially the bad scrolling performance. (I think SwiftUI might be the one to blame here.) Ivory, on the other hand, is really fast and performant. The great thing is that you can change at any time.</li>
<li>üïπÔ∏è I&rsquo;ve played the two new <strong>playdate games</strong> that were released for me this week: <a href="https://play.date/games/flipper-lifter/">Flipper Lifter</a> and <a href="https://play.date/games/echoic-memory/">Echoic Memory</a>. I am really bad at audio and don&rsquo;t know if I enjoy Echoic Memory and I haven&rsquo;t found any access to Flipper Lifter yet. In general, with some playdate games, I sometimes feel like I don&rsquo;t really understand the mechanics of the game, and just do anything that will somehow get me to the goal. I sometimes wish the games would introduce you a little more and not leave you completely out in the cold.</li>
<li>üïπÔ∏è In the end, everything was overshadowed by the fact that my <strong>playdate</strong> probably <strong>has</strong> a <strong>faulty battery</strong>. I have, surprisingly unexpectedly, received an answer from <a href="https://social.panic.com/@cabel/109757052741921514">Cabel</a>, but unfortunately not yet from support. They seem to be quite overwhelmed by support requests right now.</li>
<li>üì± On <strong>iOS</strong>, I looked at <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1489443070">Countdown to Anything!</a> but I think I&rsquo;ll stick with <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/countdowns-termine-verfolgen/id917514700">Countdowns</a>.</li>
<li>üì± This <a href="https://social.lol/@inkeduprunner/109744118273037005">screenshot</a> of Jason&rsquo;s homescreen inspired me to tinker a little bit with <a href="https://social.lol/@inkeduprunner/109744118273037005">Widgy</a>. I also bought <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/opener-open-links-in-apps/id989565871">Opener</a>, don&rsquo;t know why üòá</li>
<li>üíª On the <strong>Mac</strong>, I&rsquo;ve been looking at the new <a href="https://thebrowser.company">Arc</a> browser, which is kind of hyped right now. I really don&rsquo;t know why though. I have a bit of a suspicion that it might just be the invite system. To me, the browser seems extremely sluggish. My password management and Apple Pay don&rsquo;t work, which is probably not the browser&rsquo;s fault. It&rsquo;s too early to judge, but so far I always go back to Safari after a short time.</li>
<li>üíª It came to my mind, that you can use Markdown links of <a href="https://mastodon.cloud/@cogsciapps/109758770719895321">hooked</a> items together with <a href="https://sindresorhus.com/one-thing">One Thing</a>, an App that I really enjoy. It gives you one click menu bar item to the one file you are just working on.</li>
<li>üíª I had a look at <a href="https://hidock.app/">HiDock, for Mac</a> and <a href="https://thelasso.app/">Lasso - Window Manager for macOS</a>.</li>
<li>üíª Thanks to <a href="https://social.lol/@mken/109750124058233654">Matthew</a> I became aware of <a href="https://menubarx.app">Menubar X</a> (<a href="https://setapp.com/de/apps/menubarx">Setapp</a>). This works pretty well together with <a href="https://www.deepl.com/translator">DeepL</a> / <a href="https://www.deepl.com/write">DeepL Write</a> and <a href="https://elk.zone/">elk.zone</a>.</li>
<li>‚úÖ I&rsquo;ve moved all my todo item for work from <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a> to Apple&rsquo;s Reminders app. I want to see if I can separate them enough thanks to smart lists and tags. The only thing I miss so far is the ability to filter by focus modes, like it is possible with Calendars, etc. Only Apple knows why this is not possible yet, I guess.</li>
<li>‚ù§Ô∏è Thanks to <a href="https://social.lol/@faisal/109750741237166481">Faisal Misle</a>, I now also know that you can publish to the omg.lol weblog via <a href="https://github.com/neatnik/weblog.lol">github</a>. I have no idea about all these things, but thanks to the many great tutorials, even I managed to do it. Speaking of <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> and how clueless I am about all this internet stuff, I managed to change my <a href="https://esamecar.status.lol">status.log</a> via the <a href="https://api.omg.lol/">API</a>, again thanks to the awesome docs. I control this with a Shortcuts shortcut and can trigger it from my <a href="https://www.elgato.com/">Stream Deck</a> and <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a>. You can do so many funny things with this ü•∞</li>

			 <p>Streak, this is the third time this year I&rsquo;ve managed to write down what I&rsquo;ve done during the week.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in what it was like before, you can read about the <a href="https://esamecar.net/2023/01/08/what-i-have.html">first</a> and <a href="https://esamecar.net/2023/01/15/what-i-have.html">second</a> week.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have been very busy at work this week. So there was less to discover. I did a lot of walking with the dog (~ 50 km from Monday to Saturday so far), so at least I had enough time to listen to podcasts:
<ul>
<li>üéôÔ∏è I really enjoyed <a href="https://overcast.fm/+6u827rjC0">Really Specific Stories: John Siracusa</a>. A podcast I did not know about before. This was a very intimate conversation and I discovered so much of myself in what was told. Unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t even begin to speak with such reflection and eloquence. There&rsquo;s definitely a reason I&rsquo;m not a podcaster, and an absolutely insignificant little fish otherwise. What I also found very interesting was <a href="https://overcast.fm/+B7ND0zcCY">The Talk Show: ‚ÄòSlow-Moving Hurricane‚Äô, With Craig Hockenberry</a>. I only knew Craig Hockenberry from <a href="https://mastodon.social/@chockenberry">his posts and profile picture</a>. I was very surprised to listen to such a level-headed, reflective person. It&rsquo;s always exciting what impressions you get about people just by reading about them or listening to them. The episode <a href="https://overcast.fm/+6u81QBHHQ">Really Specific Stories: Jason Burk</a> fit in very well with this. I&rsquo;m already looking forward to the others.</li>
<li>üéôÔ∏è Parallel to the release of the two new games <a href="https://play.date/games/lost-your-marbles/">Lost Your Marbles</a> and <a href="https://play.date/games/pickpackpup/">Pick Pack Pup</a> in Series 1 for <a href="https://esamecar.net/2023/01/07/playdate.html">my playdate</a> I listened to the respective podcast episodes: <a href="https://overcast.fm/+5Ddo1eC7M">Playdate Podcast: Pick Pack Pup</a> and <a href="https://overcast.fm/+5DdrMprw0">Playdate Podcast: Lost Your Marbles</a>.</li>
<li>üéôÔ∏è Additionally I&rsquo;ve listened to <a href="https://overcast.fm/+Fcm_P4vGY">Upgrade: 441: Qi2: Qi Harder</a>, <a href="https://overcast.fm/+I5CmMcSjU">AppStories: Read-Later Apps</a>, <a href="https://overcast.fm/+Fcm-buxIs">Upgrade: 442: Zombie Arms and Toaster Fridge</a>, <a href="https://overcast.fm/+FgnYjcuX0">Under the Radar: 260: Subscription School</a>, and <a href="https://overcast.fm/+FXx6P7vZI">Connected: 433: The Best Alarm is the Alarm</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For these posts, I was looking for a way to log the podcast episodes I was listening to, but couldn&rsquo;t find a way to look them up in <a href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a>. So I wrote a Shortcuts script that logs the currently playing episode to a Drafts document after 30 seconds.</li>
<li>ü•ò Speaking of the Shortcuts app. I love <a href="https://mela.recipes">Mela</a> and in my family we use <a href="https://www.ponlist.de">Pon</a> for shopping lists. Unfortunately, there is no way to export shopping lists directly from Mela to Pon. And it is not possible to import the corresponding Reminders list into Pon. So I put together a little <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/9c1fa9b21f574dfd81d65e8ae55e8305">shortcut</a> that somehow does the job.</li>
<li>‚ù§Ô∏è I was playing around with my <a href="https://now.esamecar.net">omg/now</a> page.</li>
<li>üíª I bought <a href="https://www.houdah.com/photosWorkbench/">Photos Workbench</a>. I think I will mainly use it to compare and select pictures. I really miss a corresponding function in the Photos app. I have looked a lot for alternatives and had even subscribed to Lightroom in the meantime. But that&rsquo;s a complete overkill and I don&rsquo;t want to have any more software from that company. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m happy that an app has now been released that will hopefully take care of that.</li>
<li>üïπÔ∏è Played <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/pick-pack-pup/3030-82889/">Pick Pack Pup (2022)</a> and the first ten levels of <a href="https://social.lol/@esamecar/109727415412705797">Gravity Express</a>. The former is fine but I did not fell in love so far. The latter ist very similar to <a href="https://possiblyaxolotl.itch.io/rocketbytes">Rocket Bytes</a> but Gravity Express has checkpoints, tasks, fuel, etc. I seems not that hardcore as the other. I really like what I&rsquo;ve seen so far.</li>
<li>üóºStumbled across <a href="https://lantern.rknight.me">Lantern</a>.</li>
<li>Bought <a href="https://mstdn.plus/@lapcatsoftware/109718227833446585">Homecoming for Mastodon</a>. I think this can easily be done via Shortcuts too but anyways &hellip;</li>
<li>üì∫ No TV, now movies this week üò¢</li>
<li>üßäGave the <a href="https://github.com/Dimillian/IceCubesApp">IceCubeApp</a> beta another try. Unlike many others, I&rsquo;m not warming up to the app. It has too many little bugs that make it hard for me to use it regularly. But of course, the whole <a href="https://social.lol/@esamecar/109717531311835254">App Store approval saga</a> was funny - or rather the opposite.</li>
<li>üéôÔ∏è<a href="https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper/large">MacWhisper</a>: It&rsquo;s absolutely impressive what&rsquo;s now possible.</li>
<li>üí¨ Too much <a href="https://social.lol/@esamecar">Mastodon</a> but I really like it there. And <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber">Gruber</a> even replied to me. He <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/109723774597173088">disagreed</a> and I didn&rsquo;t want to argue, but whatever!</li>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>After all, this is the second time this year that I&rsquo;ve managed to <a href="https://esamecar.net/2023/01/08/what-i-have.html">write down a bit</a> what has been keeping me busy during the week. ü•≥</p>
<ul>
<li>üòî So, this was my first week at work and thus, unfortunately, again far too little time for things I really enjoy. (I&rsquo;ll have to think about my work situation in great detail at some point).</li>
<li>üïπ Playdate: After the two pre-installed games on my playdate, the first two new games included  in Episode 1 arrived for me on Monday: <a href="https://play.date/games/crankin/">Crankin&rsquo;s Time Travel Adventure </a> and <a href="https://play.date/games/boogie-loops/">Boogie Loops</a>. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m completely musically untalented, so I haven&rsquo;t looked at Boogie Loops yet, but I despair of Crankin&rsquo;s Time Travel Adventure. As a now completely inexperienced player, I fail grandiosely at this game. For me it is extremely difficult. I just got to level 20 and I was <a href="https://social.lol/@phils/109676285675288252">told</a> that there must be 50 levels. Another game on the list of games I will never play through. <a href="https://rngpartygames.itch.io/bloom">Bloom</a> meanders along. I find it a bit of a pity that in the dialogues there are really only the same statements available, each worded a little differently. I don&rsquo;t feel that you can really influence the story. I&rsquo;m not 100% sure if I would buy the game again. I had a quick look at <a href="https://ronlent.itch.io/eyeland">EYELAND</a>. However, it doesn&rsquo;t support savegames and so far I haven&rsquo;t felt like trying to tackle it in one go.</li>
<li>üéß Podcasts: Despite the ones I regularly listen to (<a href="https://atp.fm">ATP</a>, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/">The Talk Show</a>, <a href="https://www.relay.fm/automators">Automators</a>, <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected">Connected</a>, <a href="https://www.ridehome.info/show/techmeme-ride-home/">Techmeme Ride Home</a>) and due to <a href="https://esamecar.net">my</a> recent interest in <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a> and <a href="https://home.omg.lol">omg.lol</a>, I stumbled upon <a href="https://hemisphericviews.com">Hemispheric Views</a> by <a href="https://micro.blog/canion/">Andrew Canion</a>, <a href="https://micro.blog/burk">Jason Burk</a>, and <a href="https://micro.blog/martinfeld">Martin Feld</a> as well as <a href="https://coreint.org">Core Intuition</a> by <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">Manton Reece</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@danielpunkass">Daniel Jalkut</a>.</li>
<li>üìî I&rsquo;ve written a follow up post to my <a href="https://esamecar.net/2023/01/12/a-short-list.html">short list of non-work related macOS apps I really like</a>: <a href="https://esamecar.net/2023/01/14/even-more-macos.html">Even more macOS apps I enjoy using</a> üòé</li>
<li>üçø I&rsquo;ve watched <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/76600-avatar-the-way-of-water">Avatar: The Way of Water</a> in the cinema with my family. Bombastic, sure, but - as expected - completely irrelevant and above all predictable plot. Still, I didn&rsquo;t regret going to the cinema again.</li>
<li>üì∫ Together with my wife I finished watching the third season of <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/87917-for-all-mankind/season/3">For All Mankind</a>. I think I liked it better than the second and I&rsquo;m looking forward to the fourth.</li>
<li>ü§ì Because of <a href="https://home.omg.lol">omg.lol</a> , I tried to understand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a>. It&rsquo;s been a long time since I was on it. It felt like back in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga">Amiga</a> days. I&rsquo;ve installed <a href="https://irssi.org/">irssi</a> via <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, was able to connect, but failed with its operation. I&rsquo;ll have to look at it again some other time. Even though I am not a fan of, I understand very well why <a href="https://discord.com">Discord</a> etc. have become famous ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</li>
<li>üç© I&rsquo;ve 3Dprinted some small things, primarily for household or work purposes, such as an <a href="https://www.printables.com/de/model/96617-ipad-stand">iPad Stand</a>, to use it as a second monitor at work and a <a href="https://www.printables.com/de/model/295408-tea-bag-drainer-v2/files">tea bag drainer</a>. And of course things for my AnkerMake M5 itself, like <a href="https://www.printables.com/de/model/304873-ankermake-m5-spare-parts-box/files">Spare Parts Box</a> and <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/345230-accessory-bins-for-ankermake-m5">Accessory Bins</a>. (I was already afraid that this is another hobby that is only concerned with itself. In other words, you do things with it that you only do because you now have this thing that does things &hellip; You understand me.)</li>
<li>ü§Ø For me, I still haven&rsquo;t been able to conclusively determine on which platform I want to follow whom and where I want to post something and how. The interoperability of the fedivers (micro.blog &lt;-&gt; mastodon together with RSS etc.) is ingenious, but it also leads to a lot of friction and redundancy at least for me. I definitely need to get better at this. In all the experimenting I&rsquo;ve been doing over the last few days, I&rsquo;ve often had the problem of finding the exact URL of an RSS feed. To achive this via Reeder or similar was too cumbersome  for me and the times when the browser I use simply displayed the feeds prominently are also long gone. I have therefore created an iOS/macOS <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/fcaa7a4964ff4c078a6a13047a59fdfe">shortcuts</a>. I&rsquo;m not good at it, but it does the job I hope.</li>
<li>üë®‚Äçüíª Oh, I almost forgot. The battery on my private Intel MacBook Pro was dead. I had it replaced. It cost me ‚Ç¨ 229 - not exactly cheap. But the whole thing, including sending it in (to the Czech Republic, repair and return) took less than three days üëè. However, I got a new top case with a new keyboard etc., which probably wasn&rsquo;t a bad idea for that model. Since it had already been in use for several years, I decided to completely rebuild it. I would have preferred to save myself the experience. So many little macOS (iCloud) bugs in the process really annoyed me and the new system settings are hell.</li>

			 <p>Sure, shortly after I&rsquo;ve published the <a href="https://mb.esamecar.net/2023/01/12/a-short-list.html">short list of non-work related macOS apps I really like</a> it came to my mind, that I forgot the most important ones. But hey, I never claimed it was an exhaustive list üòá
So, I&rsquo;ll just continue and list randomly some more apps, I enjoy using:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mela.recipes">Mela</a>: <em>&ldquo;Mela is a simple, elegant and modern recipe manager that syncs with iCloud.&quot;</em> I recently switched from <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/paprika-recipe-manager-3/id1303222628?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink">Paprika</a>, which is also a very good recipe manager. But I do prefer the app from Silvio Rizzi (<a href="https://gloria.social/@rizzi">Mastodon/rizzi@gloria.social</a>) because of its more modern design and the build in recipe RSS feature üë®‚Äçüç≥. RSS is something Silvio knows a lot about, as he is also responsible for my RSS reader of choice:</li>
<li><a href="https://reederapp.com">Reeder</a>: <em>&ldquo;Keep control of your news reading with Reeder, RSS reader and read later client in one app, now with support for iCloud syncing.&quot;</em> Of course there is a bunch of other RSS readers üì∞. If I had to switch, I would probably go with <a href="https://netnewswire.com">NetNewsWire</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://dropoverapp.com">Dropover</a>: <em>&ldquo;Dropover is a macOS utility that makes Drag and Drop easier. Stash, gather or move draggable content without having to open side-by-side windows.&quot;</em> Before I&rsquo;ve stumbled upon Dropover I&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://eternalstorms.at/yoink/mac/">Yoink</a> for years (<a href="https://setapp.com/">Setapp</a>). I do like both apps. With the former, you don&rsquo;t always have to wander üñ±Ô∏è all the way to the edge of the screen to drop files. I kind of liked that. Yoink also has a counterpart for <a href="https://eternalstorms.at/yoink/ios/">iOS</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://soulver.app">Soulver</a>: <em>&ldquo;Soulver is a notepad calculator app for Mac. It&rsquo;s a notepad that gives instant answers to calculations in your text.&quot;</em> Soulver is also such a macOS classic. Since version 3, the Mac app is unfortunately no longer compatible with the iOS version and I have a little impression that the developer has lost a little desire ü•±. But nevertheless, it&rsquo;s a great tool. [<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update 19.01.2023<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: I have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->learned<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, that the iOS version has been discontinued but instead the Mac version is now on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Setapp<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</li>
<li><a href="https://moneymoney-app.com/">Money Money</a>: <em>&ldquo;Alle Bankkonten im Blick mit MoneyMoney.&quot;</em> Okay, Money Money is specific to the German market. But if you have a bank account there and don&rsquo;t want to deal with the web interface of your bank üè¶, Money Money is a great choice. The app only costs money once and I don&rsquo;t remember ever being asked to pay for an update. (That scares me a little bit, I have to admit).</li>
<li><a href="https://dayoneapp.com/blog/day-one-version-3-for-macos/">Day One</a>: <em>&ldquo;Day One is a journaling app for the iPhone, iPad and Mac. From once-in-a-lifetime events to everyday moments, Day One‚Äôs elegant interface makes journaling your life a simple pleasure.&quot;</em> My first entry üìî dates back to 2012, and I have ~10 k entries saved in there. I think that says it all üòÑ I do pipe a lot of stuff to Day One with the help of <a href="https://ifttt.com">ifttt</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.macbartender.com/">Bartender 4</a>: <em>&ldquo;Bartender is an award-winning app for macOS that superpowers your menu bar, giving you total control over your menu bar items, what&rsquo;s displayed, and when, with menu bar items only showing when you need them.&quot;</em> I run a lot of menu bar apps. Therefore this app (<a href="https://setapp.com/">Setapp</a>) is indispensable for me on my 13&rdquo; MacBook üíª. Speaking of menu bar apps:</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/coca/id1000808993?mt=12">Coca</a>: <em>&ldquo;Coca is a tiny app that puts an icon in your menu bar. Right-click the icon to prevent your system from automatically going to sleep, dimming the screen or starting screen savers.&quot;</em> Very handy in certain circumstances, e.g. you want that backup / download to finish over night etc. There are lots of similar apps, like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12">Amphetamine</a> or <a href="https://intelliscapesolutions.com/apps/caffeine">Caffeine</a> ‚òï.</li>
<li><a href="https://v2.airbuddy.app/">AirBuddy</a>: <em>&ldquo;Take Control of Your Wireless Devices on macOS.&quot;</em> If you own Air Pods üéß and want to switch from iPhone to Mac, have a look at this utility (<a href="https://setapp.com/">Setapp</a>). And speaking of music:</li>
<li><a href="https://www.neptunesmac.app/">NepTunes</a>: <em>&ldquo;A desktop accessory that allows you to see and control your music (Apple Music, Spotify) with customizable shortcuts, advanced Last.fm support and beautiful themes.&quot;</em> Any nice app that results in me having to open Apple&rsquo;s music üéµ app less often is a win.</li>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Here is a short list of apps I use a lot under macOS privately (so not only work related) or I have recently discovered and think I&rsquo;ll stick with them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://bunchapp.co/docs/">Bunch</a>: Bunch describes itself as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;a macOS utility that uses plain text scripts called ‚ÄúBunches‚Äù to automate context switching. It sits in your menu [&hellip;]. Bunches can open apps, specific files, web pages, and more. For the Power Users, It also allows advanced scripting, system commands, and integration via a URL handler&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s free to download, developed by <a href="https://nojack.easydns.ca/@ttscoff">Brett Terpstra</a>. I switched from <a href="https://www.apptorium.com/workspaces">Workspaces</a> by <a href="https://www.apptorium.com">Apptorium</a>, which has a much more sophisticated visual concept. I also like the app very much and is also available via <a href="https://setapp.com/">Setapp</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Typinator<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Enter words, sentences, or even entire paragraphs by typing just a few characters. Save time for the really important things in life.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> If I use a Mac without Typinator installed, I can hardly operate it. Therefore, it is one of the first programmes I add. (The second one is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1Password<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but if I would start from scratch I would try to use the new build in password manager of macOS / iOS.) Many use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Textexpander<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but I feel more comfortable without a subscription model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.raycast.com">Raycast</a>: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Raycast is a blazingly fast, totally extendable launcher. It lets you complete tasks, calculate, share common links, and much more.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Before I discovered Raycast, I&rsquo;ve used Launchbar for over 15 years. It was one of these apps I would have taken with me to an lonely island. Other apps like <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a> did not stick with me. I still like <a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html">Launchbar</a> a lot but enjoy the I am currently enjoying the immense expandability and dynamic development of Raycast. Right now Raycast made even my beloved window manager <a href="https://manytricks.com/moom/">Moom</a> obsolete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.craft.do">Craft</a>: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Create documents, make impact.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I really enjoyed using Craft for some time. But actually I think, I should not use another note silo and try to achieve what I want with Apple Notes. Nevertheless, the app is very comprehensive, cross platform and easy to begin with. If you have a <a href="https://setapp.com/de/apps/craft">Setapp</a> subscription, you should definitely check it out. (At this point, of course, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Obsidian<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Notion<!-- raw HTML omitted --> must also be mentioned, but neither of which I use in a private context so far.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://anybox.app">Anybox</a>: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Manage bookmarks like a pro. A perfect replacement for your browser‚Äôs bookmark manager.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I have never been able to make friends with Safari&rsquo;s bookmark management and used to use various services, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)">del.icio.us</a>. Then I migrated to <a href="">pinboard.in</a>, and in the meantime I only used it sporadically. <a href="https://get-pins.app">Pins</a>, a very good iOS / macOS pinboard client by <a href="https://mastodon.social/@anhdo">Anh Do</a>, motivated me again to use pinboard more extensively. But recently my use declined rapidly again - I don&rsquo;t know exactly why. I didn&rsquo;t like well-known alternatives like <a href="https://raindrop.io">raindrop.io</a> and then Anybox came along. It&rsquo;s available for macOS and iOS and more or less saves everthing but I use it solely as a bookmark manager. I&rsquo;m actually very happy with it, although I&rsquo;m curious to see whether the developer of pins can motivate me to switch again with his new app <a href="https://indieapps.space/@interlink">Interlink</a>. (I hardly know why I save my bookmarks in the first place. Most of the time I look them up again using a search engine anyway.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cleanshot.com">CleanShot X</a>: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Capture your Mac‚Äôs screen like a pro.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Before I stumbled across CleanShot X, I used the native screenshot function of macOS, which is also quite extensive. In addition I used <a href="https://owlocr.com">OwlOCR</a>. A utility that allows you to capture areas of the screen and then copy the text contained therein directly to the clipboard. (<a href="https://textsniper.app/de">Textsniper</a> is also often recommended, but I liked the pricing and the support of OwlOCR much better. BTW Textsniper is on <a href="https://setapp.com/">Setapp</a>.) I use this function daily and frequently. I would not want to do without it any more. In the meantime, on the latest version of macOS it is possible to extract text with board tools, at least in photos and I think also in other apps, but I have become so used to cmd+shift+2 (my assigned shortcut) that I no longer want to do without it. What does all this have to do with CleanShot? This function is also implemented and so much more. Also available via <a href="https://setapp.com/">Setapp</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/">Rocket</a>: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Mind-blowing emoji on your Mac.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I really enjoy using this emoji picker. Tried using the one from Recast but went back to Rocket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amicoapps.com/app/quitall/">Quitall</a>: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Before you Force Quit, QuitAll. A fresh start without a restart.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> If it wasn&rsquo;t included in my <a href="https://setapp.com/">Setapp</a> subscription I probably would not have bought it. I know it&rsquo;s a bad habit under macOS to quit apps but sometimes I have so many of them open, that I prefer a fresh start. That&rsquo;s were Quintal comes into play.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://hookproductivity.com">Hookmark</a>: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Search Less. Focus more.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> If you haven&rsquo;t heart of Hookmark yet, go and check it out. It&rsquo;s really awesome and I wish something like this was build directly into macOS. You can more or less interlink everything. Also available via <a href="https://setapp.com/">Setapp</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And of course there are some productivity apps I mainly use for work <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dash<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DevonThink<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Default Folder X<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Keyboard Maestro<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hazel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ChronoSync<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Maybe I&rsquo;ll write a little more about them later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, I would have forgotten about <a href="https://bombich.com/de">CCC</a>: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;CCC does everything you wish Time Machine did (and more!)&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Buy it, use it! (Or <a href="https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper!</a> I don&rsquo;t care üòé)</p>
</li>
</ul>

			 <p>I was motivated by <a href="https://micro.blog/muhh">muhh</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.byzero.de/2023/01/08/week-its-a.html">blog entry</a> to write down what was on my mind in the first week of January. I&rsquo;m not sure yet if this will become something more regular, but I wanted to start putting something online more often anyway - more on that below.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the last two weeks off. The weather was bad, I had a cold ü§ß and therefore a lot of cycling wasn&rsquo;t an option either (at least that&rsquo;s what I told myself). So, I used the time to hang out at the computer a little more than usally. There was a lot of exciting things to discover there.
Somehow Elon started this with the downfall of twitter, which he initiated. I had only been there reading for years anyway, and then after the takeover I decided to download my data, delete the clients on my end devices and no longer use the account.</p>
<p>As an alternative, I was of course interested in Mastodon and clicked an account on the standard instance <a href="https://mastodon.social">mastodon.social</a>. Thanks to tools like <a href="https://www.movetodon.org">movetodon</a> and <a href="https://glitch.com/~fedifinder">fedifinder</a> my timeline has also filled up pretty quickly, and I actually &ldquo;met&rdquo; pretty quickly some real people with whom you could exchange ideas in a friendly manner. All in all a very positive experience.</p>
<p>One great thing about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">fediverse </a> is the extreme dynamics of the tools and clients that are currently being built around it. It feels like back in the early days of Twitter where, for example, a single programmer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loren_Brichter">Loren Brichter</a>, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweetie">Tweetie</a> could turn the whole twitter landscape upside down. (BTW he only has an <a href="https://mastodon.cloud/@loren">inactive account</a> on Mastodon üò¢)</p>
<p>I tried countless clients over a few days. Among others (unsorted)</p>
<ul>
<li>Ice Cubes for Mastodon (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->beta<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) by <a href="https://mastodon.social/@dimillian">@dimillian</a> (<a href="@icecubesapp@mastodon.cloud">@icecubesapp</a>),</li>

<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mastodon/id1571998974">Mastodon</a> (official app),</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/toot/id1229021451">Toot!</a> (on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mastodon<!-- raw HTML omitted -->),</li>
<li>Komondor (beta) by <a href="https://chaos.social/@343max">@343max@chaos.social</a> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and</li>
<li>Ivory (beta; officially alpha ;-)</li>
</ul>
<p>The official app is okay, but IMHO not great; toot! I liked the range of functions very much, but you also have to cope with the strange design somehow. Because I follow some accounts that post a lot, and since the timeline on Mastodon is not orchestrated by any algorithms, posts from other people are in danger of being lost. Thats why a good list function is very important to me personally. There, Mammoth also makes a very good impression, but in the end I was lucky and was able to test <a href="https://tapbots.social/@ivory">Ivory</a> via Testflight. The app by <a href="https://tapbots.social/@paul">Paul Haddad</a> and <a href="https://tapbots.social/@mark">Mark Jardine</a> has an button design that is a bit too playful for my taste, but otherwise it is extremely stable and really great at everything it does. The recently added <a href="https://social.lol/@esamecar/109653526172609597">list features</a> are awesome, as they allow certain accounts to be hidden from the home view. So, atm I stick to Ivory and am looking forward to even better builds.</p>
<p>Then, sometime last week, I came across a <a href="https://social.lol/@otaviocc/109607448264194924">post</a> from <a href="https://social.lol/@otaviocc">@otaviocc@social.lol</a> on <a href="https://home.omg.lol">omg.lol</a>. And then, coincidentally, I signed up for the service with thousands of other people (<a href="https://omglol.news/2023/01/07/wildest-36-hours-ever">who must have read a post on Hacker News</a> and not otaviocc&rsquo;s post üòé).
On omg.lol you ultimately get a &ldquo;funny&rdquo; address on the web that contains a wide variety of small services. A single page website (to use as a <a href="https://esamecar.omg.lol">business card</a>), a <a href="http://esamecar.status.lol">statuslog</a>, an omg.lol-email address (forwarder), different DNS services, pastebin, PURL service, a <a href="http://esamecar.weblog.lol">weblog</a> (beta), etc. And while I was at it anyways, I also have my <a href="https://social.lol/@esamecar">Mastodon</a> account moved from mastodon.social to <a href="https://social.lol">social.lol</a>. Luckily that went really smoothly. It was a lot of fun getting involved, configuring everything and thinking about what it&rsquo;s even good for ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I continued to work with the <a href="https://www.ankermake.com/eu-en">AnkerMake M5</a>, which also arrived after a very long wait at the beginning of December. All in all I&rsquo;m very happy with the 3D printer, but still don&rsquo;t really know what got into me back in early 2022 when I backed it on Kickstarter. But that is definitely going too far at this point and maybe I&rsquo;ll go into more detail elsewhere.</p>
<p>Well, micro.blog is kind of a universe in itself too. In addition to choosing a <a href="https://social.lol/@muhh/109652832580041607">theme</a>, there is of course the client question. I got some for iOS (the official <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1253201335">app</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1437753701">Gluon for Micro.blog</a> and MacOS (<a href="https://redsweater.com/marsedit">MarsEdit 5</a>, which I use via <a href="https://setapp.com">Setapp</a>) looked at various editors (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ia-writer/id775737172">iA Writer</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/drafts/id1236254471">Drafts</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/runestone-text-editor/id1548193893">Runestone</a>. In addition, there are useful tools as <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696">Mimi Uploader</a> (iOS) to upload images and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1592173492">Epilogue for Micro.blog</a> to track books, but I&rsquo;m just starting out here, there are just too many apps and I have to see which ones &ldquo;click&rdquo; for me.</p>
<p>There are of course all sorts of little helpers for publishing interesting links and posts on Mastodon or blog entries. Among others <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/linky-for-twitter-and-mastodon/id438090426">Linky</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/re-toot/id1661697436">Re: Toot</a> by <a href="https://social.lol/@simonbs@mastodon.social">Simon B. St√∏vring</a> (who, by the way, is also responsible for Runestone) I would like to mention at this point.</p>
<p>As if all that wasn&rsquo;t enough, at the beginning of last week, after a 1.5 year wait, I received my long-awaited <a href="https://play.date">playdate</a> game console. (In the meantime I had actually already forgotten that I had even ordered it and I was all the happier that it suddenly arrived.) It&rsquo;s a lot of fun to deal with the little yellow box and I wanted to jot down some impressions I got. I rented a domain with Wordpress installed last year already and tried a few things with <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a> but didn&rsquo;t really publish anything on either platform. This year I wanted to change that and thus started with a <a href="https://esamecar.de/2023/01/07/playdate.html">post about the playdate</a>.</p>
<p>All in all, it was an exciting time in terms of IT. Now all of a sudden I somehow have <a href="https://esamecar.de/2023/01/07/hello-world.html">three blogs</a> and will soon have to concentrate on one of them and see when everyday work starts again tomorrow, whether I still have the time and, above all, the desire to continue writing down my thoughts, or these escapades were again one of my &ldquo;manic&rdquo; excursions into something new and I would lose interest again the day after tomorrow - which would be a pity.</p>
<p>So, maybe cu next week üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
<p>PS: initally, I wanted to talk a little bit about the music and podcasts I&rsquo;ve listened to, too but this post is already way too long.</p>

			 <p>I have been using <a href="https://www.shelly.cloud/de">Shelly Plug S</a> plug adapters for some time now and am very happy with them. They are inexpensive, run reliably and can be controlled easily within your own network via REST API. The only thing they are not compatible with is HomeKit. Thanks to <a href="https://www.appgefahren.de/shelly-plug-s-smarter-zwischenstecker-fuer-1590-euro-im-angebot-329891.html">appgefahren.de</a> I just stumbled across a custom firmware published on <a href="https://github.com/mongoose-os-apps/shelly-homekit">github</a>, which can be installed via a single URL call. Then you can hang via QR code the plug super easy in HomeKit. However, with HomeKit integration, you give up the ability to use the Shelly Cloud and therefore its native app. Of course, this should be weighed up carefully beforehand. However, the way back to the original firmware should be just as easy.</p>
