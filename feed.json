Predominantly, they reside on servers located in the United States, owned by American tech companies. Given the current political climate, I&rsquo;ve made an effort to migrate much of my digital life to services within the European Union.\nTo begin this digital relocation, I&rsquo;ve gone through my current services. My encrypted online backup is hosted on Microsoft&rsquo;s OneDrive. I use iCloud for emails, calendars, contacts, photo storage, passwords, music, and video streaming. I also rely on iCloud for file storage. Apple services are exceptionally well-integrated into the operating systems I use. The Family Sharing features they offer are awesome, and the stability is now commendably robust. Allegedly, most of these services are end-to-end encrypted. All seems fine, except for recent developments involving Trump, Tim Cook&rsquo;s support of him and the general attitude of Apple towards the European government. But I don&rsquo;t want to get too political at this point 😎.\nAnyhow, I made a table in my BuJo<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> and started looking around and testing stuff.

Based on very helpful feedback on Mastodon, I found out that <a href=\"https://nextcloud.com/\">NextCloud</a> can be quite well used as a managed service at <a href=\"https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-share/\">Hetzner</a> for a reasonable amount of money. I then set up an instance there and moved all my calendars, address book<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>, tasks<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup>, and a few files and pictures. I still need to spend some time researching encryption on NextCloud and understanding its implications, but overall, it was very easy to set everything up and configure it for the whole family, including calendar sharing, and so on. What I&rsquo;ve seen so far, I like very much. Even the macOS and especially iOS apps are  quite good and you can use passkeys and add two-factor for web authentication. Files that are too sensitive to be stored in the cloud without E2EE, I have saved in a <a href=\"http://koofr.eu/\">koofr.eu</a> vault. Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s not quite as simple; you have to use <a href=\"https://rclone.org/\">rclone</a>, which is a CLI program, but it&rsquo;s generally doable. For now, I&rsquo;ve moved a few backups of my most important data there, which have so far been backed up on OneDrive with <a href=\"https://www.arqbackup.com/\">Arq</a><sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup>.\nI exported all the individual photos from my Apple Photo.app library and copied them to an encrypted koofr vault.

My Obsidian data has felt like it&rsquo;s been on European servers for years now, and I was thrilled to see that the instance of my only remaining actively used social network, Mastodon, <a href=\"https://social.lol/@adam/114283682284316702\">was moved</a> to European servers as well. Regarding maps and route planning, I am now trying to rely solely on <a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/\">OpenStreetMap</a>-based services and apps like <a href=\"https://osmand.net/\">OsmAnd</a>, or perhaps <a href=\"https://gurumaps.app/\">Guru Maps</a>. Furthermore, due to the <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/03/komoot-acquired-history-says-this-wont-end-well.html\">sale of Komoot</a>, which, while still a European company, no longer earns my trust for other reasons, I&rsquo;ve started switching to <a href=\"https://bikerouter.de/#map=5/50.990/9.860/osm-mapnik-german_style\">bikerouter.de</a>. I already knew that it&rsquo;s fantastic, but it has a considerably steeper learning curve.\nI moved my passwords back from Apple&rsquo;s password app to 1Password. I&rsquo;m not entirely happy with it<sup id=\"fnref:6\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">6</a></sup> but after all, it seems to be mainly a Canadian-based company.\nFor email, I&rsquo;ve been using <a href=\"https://posteo.de/en\">Posteo</a>, a German provider, and I am very satisfied with it. Regarding search, I haven&rsquo;t found a European provider yet that I want to use, but I&rsquo;ve been using <a href=\"https://kagi.com/\">Kagi</a> for a few months and hope that their privacy statement holds up. Searching remains an open issue.\nAdditionally, I&rsquo;ve canceled my YouTube Premium subscription and am trying not to buy anything from Amazon anymore. Maybe I&rsquo;ll just have to delete my account there to keep this up. We&rsquo;ll see.\nTo sum it up, I find it very unfortunate that it had to come to this and hope that despite the lack of integration, the various apps and services will still work as reliably as they have. Time will tell for sure.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>This might become another post someday.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>Unfortunately, it appears that contact groups are not supported under macOS when synced via CardDAV; you can only use one address book.

Furthermore, due to the [sale of Komoot](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/03/komoot-acquired-history-says-this-wont-end-well.html), which, while still a European company, no longer earns my trust for other reasons, I've started switching to [bikerouter.de](https://bikerouter.de/#map=5/50.990/9.860/osm-mapnik-german_style). I already knew that it's fantastic, but it has a considerably steeper learning curve.\nI moved my passwords back from Apple's password app to 1Password. I'm not entirely happy with it[^6] but after all, it seems to be mainly a Canadian-based company.\nFor email, I've been using [Posteo](https://posteo.de/en), a German provider, and I am very satisfied with it. Regarding search, I haven't found a European provider yet that I want to use, but I've been using [Kagi](https://kagi.com/) for a few months and hope that their privacy statement holds up. Searching remains an open issue.\nAdditionally, I've canceled my YouTube Premium subscription and am trying not to buy anything from Amazon anymore. Maybe I'll just have to delete my account there to keep this up. We'll see.\nTo sum it up, I find it very unfortunate that it had to come to this and hope that despite the lack of integration, the various apps and services will still work as reliably as they have. Time will tell for sure.\n\n[^1]: This might become another post someday.  \n[^2]: Unfortunately, it appears that contact groups are not supported under macOS when synced via CardDAV; you can only use one address book. It seems to work under iOS, though. I guess only Apple knows why.  \n[^3]: There seems to be no way to export my reminders and tasks properly; I had to transfer them all by hand, except for those that are already managed in my bullet journal, which fortunately were not many.  \n[^4]: I am still searching for a service where I can use Arq again; however, that hasn't worked out yet. I would really like to have an incremental backup of all my data in the cloud.  \n[^5]: [Filen](https://filen.io/) might be something to look into as well.\n[^6]: With all the back-and-forth of moving data, it is not about having fun, but about having a better feeling afterward, I guess.\n",

Apple has presented new <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhones</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-10/\">Apple Watches</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/airpods-4/\">AirPods</a>. Thanks to Apple&rsquo;s decision to slowly and gradually roll out the promised AI features and not at all in Germany in the long run, the innovations of the iPhone 16 are limited for me. Therefore, I have decided to use my iPhone 14 Pro for another year, especially since I was recently able to replace the battery thanks to Apple Care. So far, I always had the Pro model, but this year, for the first time, I had the impression that it is actually aimed at professional photographers/videographers, and I no longer belong to the target audience. If I were to order a new device today, I would choose the regular iPhone, and who knows, maybe I&rsquo;ll get lucky, and next year the iPhone 17 will even have Always On. That would probably be the only feature I would really miss. (120 Hz is guaranteed to be great, but I actually don&rsquo;t see the difference in daily use; which in my case is an advantage.)\nIt&rsquo;s similar with my Apple Watch. Although I could justify a new one, since my Series 7 is now almost three years old, I recently got to replace the battery and see no urgent need for an upgrade. I&rsquo;m already eyeing the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-ultra-2/\">Ultra</a> anyway, and this time it hasn&rsquo;t received any technical improvements. And since I already own AirPods Pro Gen 2, I followed the announcement of the AirPods 4 with interest, but there is no risk of FOMO 🥳.</p>\n<p>Apart from Apple, the new <a href=\"https://www.goretroid.com/products/retroid-pocket-5-handheld?srsltid=AfmBOop5cCQYozTUgHs2R5uHEt03ow-9gJZDIWctOSNETsQYrNdd2lJP\">Retroid Pocket 5</a> and <a href=\"https://www.goretroid.com/collections/retro-game-system/products/retroid-pocket-mini-handheld\">Retroid Pocket Mini</a> have been announced. Despite my interest in a dedicated retro handheld with an OLED display, my <a href=\"https://www.steamdeck.com/en/\">Steam Deck OLED</a> and the other devices I already own are enough for now. The constant new hardware releases in this area are increasingly annoying me. When ordering, you already know that you&rsquo;ll be presented with a slightly improved device in a couple of weeks. The manufacturers don&rsquo;t allow you to have the feeling of truly owning the perfect device for even a minute, and it gives the impression that they are deliberately putting imperfect handhelds on the market 😡.</p>\n<p>Speaking of retro and must-have: <a href=\"https://www.analogue.co/editions/pocket-gbc-colors\">Analog Pocket</a> has announced a new special edition. This time, there are beautiful GBC colors at the usual prices and not totally overpriced <a href=\"https://www.analogue.co/editions/pocket-aluminum\">aluminium models</a>. Although it tempts me, I try to curb my collector&rsquo;s instinct 😅.</p>\n<p>The announcement of the <a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=6HaRMiTfvks\">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> initially triggered me as well, but I came to the conclusion that my current PS5 in combination with my <a href=\"https://rog.asus.com/us/monitors/27-to-31-5-inches/rog-swift-oled-pg32ucdm/\">4K OLED gaming monitor</a> is completely sufficient. Spending €800 for slightly better graphics is something I actually can&rsquo;t justify to myself.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s different with the Switch 2. I&rsquo;m curious and will probably buy it, provided Nintendo doesn&rsquo;t make any major mistakes 🤞.</p>\n",

I'm already eyeing the [Ultra](https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-ultra-2/) anyway, and this time it hasn't received any technical improvements. And since I already own AirPods Pro Gen 2, I followed the announcement of the AirPods 4 with interest, but there is no risk of FOMO 🥳.\n\nApart from Apple, the new [Retroid Pocket 5](https://www.goretroid.com/products/retroid-pocket-5-handheld?srsltid=AfmBOop5cCQYozTUgHs2R5uHEt03ow-9gJZDIWctOSNETsQYrNdd2lJP) and [Retroid Pocket Mini](https://www.goretroid.com/collections/retro-game-system/products/retroid-pocket-mini-handheld) have been announced. Despite my interest in a dedicated retro handheld with an OLED display, my [Steam Deck OLED](https://www.steamdeck.com/en/) and the other devices I already own are enough for now. The constant new hardware releases in this area are increasingly annoying me. When ordering, you already know that you'll be presented with a slightly improved device in a couple of weeks. The manufacturers don't allow you to have the feeling of truly owning the perfect device for even a minute, and it gives the impression that they are deliberately putting imperfect handhelds on the market 😡.\n\nSpeaking of retro and must-have: [Analog Pocket](https://www.analogue.co/editions/pocket-gbc-colors) has announced a new special edition. This time, there are beautiful GBC colors at the usual prices and not totally overpriced [aluminium models](https://www.analogue.co/editions/pocket-aluminum). Although it tempts me, I try to curb my collector's instinct 😅.\n\nThe announcement of the [PlayStation 5 Pro](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6HaRMiTfvks) initially triggered me as well, but I came to the conclusion that my current PS5 in combination with my [4K OLED gaming monitor](https://rog.asus.com/us/monitors/27-to-31-5-inches/rog-swift-oled-pg32ucdm/) is completely sufficient. Spending €800 for slightly better graphics is something I actually can't justify to myself.\n\nIt's different with the Switch 2. I'm curious and will probably buy it, provided Nintendo doesn't make any major mistakes 🤞.\n",

Apple is rolling out a change that will require you to give explicit permission on a weekly basis to these types of apps, and every time you reboot your Mac.\n\nI really hope this gets sorted out during the beta phase; otherwise, I will try to stay on Sonoma as long as possible. For years now, I've been waiting to upgrade until at least the first .1 release because Apple's software quality hasn't exactly inspired confidence. Additionally, Sequoia only has one new feature that genuinely interests me: iPhone Mirroring. And this won't be available for EU users initially anyway.

				"content_text": "\nIn continuation of week [29](https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/07/21/what-caught-my.html), here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the thirtieth week of 2024:\n\n- 📝 Might be handy, but not sure if I will actually use it: [WeExpire](https://weexpire.org/) - *Create emergency notes that can be read by your trusted contacts only after your death*.\n\n- 🖥️ [Apparency](https://www.mothersruin.com/software/Apparency/) for macOS - *The App That Opens Apps* - received a nice update at the beginning of the month.\n\n- 🖼️ [PicArrange](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/picarrange/id1530678223?mt=12) for macOS as well; although I have not yet found whether the text-based image search happens on-device or sends anything to the cloud.\n\n- 🤖 Meta released Llama 3.1 and it does indeed produce much better results with e.g. [Ollama](https://ollama.com/).\n\n- 🌐 [Apple Maps launches on the web in new public beta](https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/24/apple-maps-web-beta-now-available/) - practical.\n\n- 🎮 Along with a few [new applications](https://fosstodon.org/@altstore/112842555810648093), Fortnite is now even coming to the [AltStore PAL](https://mastodon.social/@rileytestut/112848981069946420). Let's see if Apple will \"coincidentally\" allow it back in the regular App Store. It's also a shame that Apple has managed to make the update and installation process so broken on my system that it barely works without restarting or reinstalling the AltStore or the apps.\n\n- 🎁 The German computer magazine [c't](https://www.heise.de/select/ct/2024/17) had a review of the [WOWCUBE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM](https://wowcube.com/) - a very cool idea. Maybe a possible Christmas gift? I'm curious whether their software platform will flop or survive.\n\n- 🔠 Might come handy someday: [Free Anagram Sentence Generator for English, German, French, and Spanish](https://anagrams.io/).\n\n- ✅ I've mentioned [One Million Checkboxes](https://onemillioncheckboxes.com/) in [week 27](https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/07/08/what-caught-my.html), here you can read a little bit more about the author's journey [Dealing with unexpected popularity](http://eieio.games/essays/scaling-one-million-checkboxes/).\n\n- 🗳️ My Mastodon timeline has become much more interested in American politics since certain events. I follow this with some interest. However, I couldn't initially understand the sudden memes about a certain person's couch. Thanks to [JD Vance couch memes, explained: Why AP pulled its story](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2024/07/jd-vance-couch-memes-associated-press), now I know.\n\n- 🚑 My wife had shoulder surgery again. It's no fun; now six weeks of complete rest are prescribed, and we really hope that the collarbone, or rather the implanted metal plate, holds this time. We had to cancel our vacation because of this. It's a shame, but her health definitely comes first.\n\n- 🧱 I have quite a huge [LEGO collection](https://brickset.com/sets/ownedby-racemase) (> 700 sets and > 2200 minifigs) but stopped collecting a while ago, mainly due to space constraints and of course because it was becoming increasingly expensive. But I might be tempted by this set: [LEGO 71438 Super Mario World: Mario & Yoshi](https://brickset.com/sets/71438-1).\n\n- 🕹️ I've preordered [Thank Goodness You're Here!](https://thankgoodness.game/) for the Switch.\n\n- 🎮 Of course, I am enjoying [Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition](https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Nintendo-World-Championships-NES-Edition-2569575.html) on my Switch quite a bit and found this [guide](https://my.nintendo.com/rewards/feba38a937fd6b81) helpful. You can download a free PDF copy if you have a myNintendo account. Additionally, I am currently playing the remake of [Dead Space](https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dead-space/dead-space?setLocale=en-gb) on the PS5.\n\n- 🎥 And fittingly: Watched [The Super Mario Bros. Movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6718170/) - it was very light entertainment, but not bad.\n\n- 📺 I think someday I should really watch all episodes of [Double Fine PsychOdyssey](https://youtu.be/kRlI72bsNRc?si=bh9hWQM4np7hSv0r).\n\nI wish you lovely summer days! 🌞\n",

But I'd rather save my energy for discussions with my teenage son, behave like an adult, and might simply take the advice to get an Android device as my next phone 😇.\n\n- 🤖 How absolutely freaking cool is this: [I made an AI LEGO® PixelArt Robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec_BtS97IR8)?!\n\n- 🎮 Speaking of awesome: [Doom x Mario Mod](https://retrododo.com/doom-x-mario-mod-is-a-game-all-nintendo-fans-need-to-see/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=doom-x-mario-mod-is-a-game-all-nintendo-fans-need-to-see).\n\n- 💻 There are some [Mac games—available at a discount for a limited time.](https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1750125921).

				"content_html": "<p>In continuation of week <a href=\"https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/06/02/what-caught-my.html\">22</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the twenty-third week of 2024:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>🔑 As the Safari integration of <a href=\"https://1password.com/\">1Password</a> is getting worse and worse - at least for me it is so buggy, that I have disabled the Safari extension and moved my passwords to Apple&rsquo;s Keychain<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> - I am looking for alternatives. I actually don&rsquo;t want to store my passwords only with Apple, either. I feel too locked in there. But using 1PW in parallel with iCloud seems weird to me in the long run. So, I looked around and for the emerging passkey front I ordered a <a href=\"https://www.token2.com/shop/product/token2-t2f2-pin-dual-release2-fido2-u2f-and-totp-dual-port-nfc-security-key-with-pin-complexity-feature\">Token2</a> security key, which arrived this week. According to its description, it &ldquo;combines hardware-based authentication, public-key cryptography, TOTP/HOTP, U2F, and FIDO2 protocols to protect your accounts.&rdquo; To make a long story short, this post-password world is still way too complicated for me. OTP/HOTP, U2F, and FIDO2?! 🤯 The token stores passkeys but also 2FA codes, and I never know what exactly where and when. Sometimes passkeys alone are enough to log in, sometimes I have to enter an additional 2FA OTP, sometimes - as with Mastodon - the 2FA seems to be the passkey and I still need a username and PW! For the token2 to work, I have to touch it, enter a 6-digit code on my Mac, and then touch it again. That&rsquo;s much more cumbersome than just putting my finger on the touch ID sensor of my Macbook. On my Mac, I can access the stored passkey (but not all or just the OTP tokens, I dont know) on the token2 only very awkwardly but at least via Chrome&rsquo;s settings page. OTP codes can be accessed via the iPhone app but not the passkeys. WTF?! I don&rsquo;t understand anything. In addition, my most important accounts still don&rsquo;t support passkeys. Parallel to this, the <a href=\"https://protonapps.com\">macOS version</a> of <a href=\"https://proton.me/pass\">ProtonPass</a> was released this week, and the <a href=\"https://account.proton.me/pass/signup?coupon=DPROMO&amp;ref=d-promo-banner&amp;currency=EUR\">annual subscription</a> could be purchased for 10 €. What the heck, I thought, and I purchased it. The Mac app seems, like 1Password, to be an Electron app, and it feels like they just released a web wrapper. It is still far from being a viable alternative. Maybe I have to hope for the rumor mill come true and enjoy Apple&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/apple-standalone-passwords-app/\">standalone password manager</a> starting this fall? Anyway, I could not agree more: <a href=\"https://birchtree.me/blog/a-passwordless-future-needs-portability/\">A Passwordless Future Needs Portability</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🚨 There was a bit of <a href=\"https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/06/05/bartender-alternatives.html\">fuss</a> this week about the app Bartender for macOS, which I have highly appreciated so far.

				"content_text": "\nIn continuation of week [22](https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/06/02/what-caught-my.html), here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the twenty-third week of 2024:\n\n- 🔑 As the Safari integration of [1Password](https://1password.com/) is getting worse and worse - at least for me it is so buggy, that I have disabled the Safari extension and moved my passwords to Apple's Keychain[^1] - I am looking for alternatives. I actually don't want to store my passwords only with Apple, either. I feel too locked in there. But using 1PW in parallel with iCloud seems weird to me in the long run. So, I looked around and for the emerging passkey front I ordered a [Token2](https://www.token2.com/shop/product/token2-t2f2-pin-dual-release2-fido2-u2f-and-totp-dual-port-nfc-security-key-with-pin-complexity-feature) security key, which arrived this week. According to its description, it \"combines hardware-based authentication, public-key cryptography, TOTP/HOTP, U2F, and FIDO2 protocols to protect your accounts.\" To make a long story short, this post-password world is still way too complicated for me. OTP/HOTP, U2F, and FIDO2?! 🤯 The token stores passkeys but also 2FA codes, and I never know what exactly where and when. Sometimes passkeys alone are enough to log in, sometimes I have to enter an additional 2FA OTP, sometimes - as with Mastodon - the 2FA seems to be the passkey and I still need a username and PW! For the token2 to work, I have to touch it, enter a 6-digit code on my Mac, and then touch it again. That's much more cumbersome than just putting my finger on the touch ID sensor of my Macbook. On my Mac, I can access the stored passkey (but not all or just the OTP tokens, I dont know) on the token2 only very awkwardly but at least via Chrome's settings page. OTP codes can be accessed via the iPhone app but not the passkeys. WTF?! I don't understand anything. In addition, my most important accounts still don't support passkeys. Parallel to this, the [macOS version](https://protonapps.com) of [ProtonPass](https://proton.me/pass) was released this week, and the [annual subscription](https://account.proton.me/pass/signup?coupon=DPROMO&ref=d-promo-banner&currency=EUR) could be purchased for 10 €. What the heck, I thought, and I purchased it. The Mac app seems, like 1Password, to be an Electron app, and it feels like they just released a web wrapper. It is still far from being a viable alternative. Maybe I have to hope for the rumor mill come true and enjoy Apple's [standalone password manager](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/apple-standalone-passwords-app/) starting this fall? Anyway, I could not agree more: [A Passwordless Future Needs Portability](https://birchtree.me/blog/a-passwordless-future-needs-portability/).\n\n- 🚨 There was a bit of [fuss](https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/06/05/bartender-alternatives.html) this week about the app Bartender for macOS, which I have highly appreciated so far. I uninstalled it and have been using [Ice](https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice) since a couple of days, as [mentioned](https://apps.icymi.lol/post/ice). It works flawlessly.\n\n- 🗺️ [Organic Maps: Offline Map on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/organic-maps-offline-map/id1567437057?ign-mpt=uo%3D4) now also supports iCloud sync.\n\n- 📚 [Sequel](https://indieapps.space/@sequel/112564001930067974), the manager for a variety of media, received a [major update](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/sequel-2-3s-magic-lookup-is-a-perfect-example-of-how-apps-should-integrate-ai/). I am actually very happy with [Booktracks](https://booktrack.app), [Gamery](https://gamery.app), and [TV Forecast](https://tvforecastapp.com), but I started testing the app again. I am not yet sure if there is a place for an additional, more general app.\n\n- 🌐 I also tried [Surfed](https://surfed.app) again because I actually find the idea of the app very cool. However, it somehow did not reliably record my history and synchronize it between my three used devices. This led to me not finding the things I was looking for, so I will let the subscription expire at the end of the month.\n\n- 📶 [Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/en/products/littlesnitch/index.html) shows network usage in the menu bar on my work computer. If you are looking for a free alternative for just this function, you can check out [‎Scaler Bandwidth Monitor](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/scaler-bandwidth-monitor/id1612708557?mt=12).\n\n- ⏲️ I have been using [Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/) for a long time, but [Horo - the best free timer app for Mac](https://matthewpalmer.net/horo-free-timer-mac/) from the same [developer](https://matthewpalmer.net) had slipped through my fingers until now.\n\n- 🍏 Apple already announced the [2024 winners and finalists - Apple Design Awards](https://developer.apple.com/design/awards/). Congrats to [‎Crouton: Recipe Manager on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crouton-recipe-manager/id1461650987). (I only wish there was an import feature for [Mela](https://mela.recipes), the app I currently use.) \n\n- 🤖 [I’m Not Anti-AI](https://mihobu.lol/2024/06/im-not-anti-ai) spoke to my soul, and since I'm already mentioning [Michael](https://mihobu.lol/about), I was very pleased with his mention in the [Junited](https://mihobu.lol/junited2024) post 🥰.\n\n- 📸 I [learned](https://toot.cafe/@codepo8/112562828562908837) that on macOS, you can open an image with Quick Look by hitting the Space bar and then just select all recognized text (⌘A) and copy it (⌘C) to your clipboard 🤯.\n\n- 🧸 I had to stop collecting [LEGO](https://brickset.com/sets/ownedby-racemase) sets due to space constraints and definitely must not buy the [Evercade Alpha Bartop Arcade System](https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/06/evercade-alpha-bartop-arcade-system-now-available-for-pre-order).\n\n- 🎮 However, I couldn't prevent myself from acquiring a Nintendo N64 console. Thanks to [2x Line Doubler](https://kaicolabs.com/product/nintendo-n64-line-doubler-hdmi/) and RetroScaler [N64 BlueRetro](https://retroreiz.de/shop/nintendo/nintendo-64-n64/zubehoer-nintendo-64/retroscaler-n64-blueretro-wireless-controller-bluetooth-adapter-fuer-nintendo-64/#) Wireless Controller Bluetooth Adapter, I can now play Mario 64 with my [Nintendo 64 Bluetooth Controller](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-64-controller/). Please don't ask why I don't just do it via Nintendo Switch Online, [EmuDeck](https://www.emudeck.com) on the Steam Deck, or simply my iPhone with [Delta](https://faq.deltaemulator.com) 🤷‍♂️.\n\n- 🎨 Speaking of which: more awesome skins for Delta: [Delta Pocket - Transparent Edition](https://store.seanfletcher.co/l/delta-pocket-gba).\n\n- 📱 And: [Nintendo 3DS Emulator for iPhone Released in App Store With Caveats](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/04/nintendo-3ds-emulator-for-iphone-on-app-store/).\n\n- 🔋 If you don't trust macOS's built-in battery management, don't use [AlDente](https://apphousekitchen.com), and are looking for another application of this kind, you might want to check out [BatFi – maximize your Mac's battery lifespan](https://micropixels.software/apps/batfi). BTW I have decided that the built-in function must suffice for me.\n\n- 🔋 Same topic, different area: [AirBattery](https://lihaoyun6.github.io/airbattery/) - *Get the battery usage of all your devices at once!* I noted it down in case [AirBuddy](https://v2.airbuddy.app) stops working someday.\n\n- 🌐 If you ask nicely, you might be able to test a new web-based feed reader: [An introduction to Sublime Feed](https://vincentritter.com/2024/06/03/an-introduction-to-sublime-feed).\n\n- 💻 [Johnny Decimal](https://commandline.johnnydecimal.com) brings Ellane the command line of macOS. If you want to dive deeper afterward, I can definitely recommend [Take Control of the Mac Command Line with Terminal](https://www.takecontrolbooks.com/command-line/).\n\n- 🛠️ I had planned [months ago](https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/02/03/what-caught-my.html) to finally dive into to the [Gridfinity](https://gridfinity.xyz/) system. Somehow, I never had the time to pick out the right base plates.

The pilot episodes were entertaining. However, based on their teasers, I honestly expected a little more than using the Reminders backend in Fantastical or playing games on the iPad with a controller to get the hosts out of their [Comfort Zone](https://www.macstories.net/comfort-zone/) 😈.\n\n- 🗣️ German-speaking readers should try the [dialect test](https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/dialekt-test-wir-wissen-woher-sie-stammen-jetzt-noch-genauer-205060715129) from the Swiss Tages-Anzeiger, which has made its rounds on the web. I'm still unsure how they fake it, but the precision of the results is amazing.\n\n- 🇪🇺 This weekend are European elections. Go vote! (And vote for a democratic party!)\n\n- 🍏 Next week is the WWDC. It will not be a bug fix year once again.

You can read some more responses to this whole saga on Michael Tsai's [blog](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/06/05/bartender-acquired-by-applause-group/).\n[^2]: Alternatively, one can potentially revert to a Bartender version prior to the sale (5.0.48) and additionally block its connections to the internet, e.g., via [Little Snitch](https://apps.icymi.lol/post/little-snitch).\n[^3]: That’s the one I just started using without any particular reason and it works just great so far.\n[^4]: Of course, there are already [speculations](https://talk.tidbits.com/t/bartender-developer-explains-and-apologizes-for-quiet-acquisition/27980/4) that the texts were not written by him and were created by ChatGPT.\n",

Installing the AltStore and downloading Delta went as smoothly as Apple currently allows, and the app is just great. Very nicely designed, customizable through <a href=\"https://skins4delta.com/\">skins</a> and comprehensive. However, I see myself rather less playing GB[AC]* games on my iPhone, as they bring more fun on the <a href=\"https://www.analogue.co/pocket\">Analogue Pocket</a> or one of my other devices with a built-in gamepad.

This app offers a free and slick interface to interact with Ollama&rsquo;s LLMs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>💻 I mainly use <a href=\"https://rectangleapp.com/pro\">Rectangle Pro</a> for window management on macOS, which also offers the possibility to throw windows into predefined areas via mouse gestures (<em>Window Throw</em>), but if you are looking for an alternative, you might want to check out the free <a href=\"https://github.com/MrKai77/Loop\">Loop</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🤖 This is so f*%king incredible: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9EM5_VFlt8\">Farewell to HD Atlas</a>.

After years of incompatibility, you can finally exchange files between macOS and iOS again. Did I mention before, that I love Soulver?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>💻 Lou blogged about apps that <a href=\"https://amerpie.lol/2024/04/15/open-at-login.html\">Open at Login</a> on his Mac, and two apps were new to me. As <a href=\"https://www.fadel.io/missioncontrolplus\">Mission Control Plus</a> - <em>Put the &ldquo;control&rdquo; back in Mission Control</em> - is included in my Setapp subscription, I started evaluating it. The app does mainly two things, it adds an X-button to Mission Control&rsquo;s windows and several keybard shortcuts managing them. The other one was <a href=\"https://github.com/nielsmouthaan/backup-status?tab=readme-ov-file\">Backup Status</a> - <em>View the status of Time Machine right from your desktop or Notification Center</em>. Bookmarked but not tried myself yet.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>💻 On <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/abettercomputer\">A Better Computer</a>, I stumbled across <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHrMLowLpDY\">10 useful Mac apps you may not have heard of</a> and found <a href=\"https://www.cleftnotes.com\">Cleft</a> quite interesting. However, it absolutely did not want to work for me and instead of transcribing my spoken text, it bombarded me with error messages and just deleted everything. Well, I might look at it again in version 1.1 or maybe 2.x.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🛠️ Whether I spend a lot of time troubleshooting to get something running that I would like to accomplish depends strongly on the platform I&rsquo;m doing it on and my expectations of the project/product.<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> With Apple products or other commercial services, my tolerance for having to spend a lot of time to make something work as it should is quite low, for example. This was also one of the reasons why I switched from Windows to macOS about 20 years ago. I just didn&rsquo;t feel like dealing with the fiddling anymore. With Linux projects, it&rsquo;s different for me. I almost expect it to be difficult, and it&rsquo;s fine with me because in general it&rsquo;s open source and I heavily benefit from the hard work from others. So, I spent countless hours trying to set up a WLAN access point on a Raspi that is connected to my network via LAN and brings the connected devices into the network via VPN. (My regular router can&rsquo;t do this, and I have one or two devices that I&rsquo;d like to connect to the network via VPN, but I can&rsquo;t install a client on them.) I ultimately failed and gave up a few weeks ago. Last week, I stumbled across the <a href=\"https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-mt3000/\">BerylAX GL-MT3000</a> and it took me no more than 5 minutes to get it up and running with <a href=\"https://nordvpn.com/\">NordVPN</a>. This really blew me away.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>⏺️ The <a href=\"https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/stream-deck-neo\">Stream Deck Neo</a> was announced and looks really compelling to me.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>📺 Continued watching <a href=\"https://trakt.tv/shows/palm-royale/seasons/1/episodes/1\">Palm Royale</a> - still not sure about this TV series.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🎥 Watch <a href=\"https://trakt.tv/movies/riders-of-justice-2020\">Riders of Justice</a> - enjoyed that one.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🕹️ Spent way too much money for discounted games on Steam and played a lot of <a href=\"https://deadcells.com\">Dead Cells</a>. Really hard but I like it a lot.<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Have a nice week! 🙋‍♂️</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>BTW I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Apple&rsquo;s spontaneous change of direction regarding emulators was related to the AltStore PAL to take some wind out of the sails of the alternative app store, but maybe I&rsquo;m going too far with that.

This app offers a free and slick interface to interact with Ollama's LLMs.\n\n- 💻 I mainly use [Rectangle Pro](https://rectangleapp.com/pro) for window management on macOS, which also offers the possibility to throw windows into predefined areas via mouse gestures (*Window Throw*), but if you are looking for an alternative, you might want to check out the free [Loop](https://github.com/MrKai77/Loop).\n\n- 🤖 This is so f*%king incredible: [Farewell to HD Atlas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9EM5_VFlt8). But of course that can still be topped: [All New Atlas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29ECwExc-_M) 🤯.\n   \n- 🦉 As already mentioned on my little [Site Project](https://apps.icymi.lol/post/dropscout), [DropScout](https://apps.apple.com/app/dropscout/id6477324347) for iOS / iPad is out of beta and available for free: *DropScout tracks your Amazon products and alerts you when prices drop!* Also mentioned there, since version 3.11, [Soulver](https://soulver.app) once again includes an iOS version that can be unlocked with a one-time purchase. After years of incompatibility, you can finally exchange files between macOS and iOS again. Did I mention before, that I love Soulver?\n\n- 💻 Lou blogged about apps that [Open at Login](https://amerpie.lol/2024/04/15/open-at-login.html) on his Mac, and two apps were new to me. As [Mission Control Plus](https://www.fadel.io/missioncontrolplus) - *Put the \"control\" back in Mission Control* - is included in my Setapp subscription, I started evaluating it. The app does mainly two things, it adds an X-button to Mission Control's windows and several keybard shortcuts managing them. The other one was [Backup Status](https://github.com/nielsmouthaan/backup-status?tab=readme-ov-file) - *View the status of Time Machine right from your desktop or Notification Center*. Bookmarked but not tried myself yet.\n\n- 💻 On [A Better Computer](https://www.youtube.com/c/abettercomputer), I stumbled across [10 useful Mac apps you may not have heard of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHrMLowLpDY) and found [Cleft](https://www.cleftnotes.com) quite interesting. However, it absolutely did not want to work for me and instead of transcribing my spoken text, it bombarded me with error messages and just deleted everything. Well, I might look at it again in version 1.1 or maybe 2.x.\n\n- 🛠️ Whether I spend a lot of time troubleshooting to get something running that I would like to accomplish depends strongly on the platform I'm doing it on and my expectations of the project/product.[^2] With Apple products or other commercial services, my tolerance for having to spend a lot of time to make something work as it should is quite low, for example. This was also one of the reasons why I switched from Windows to macOS about 20 years ago. I just didn't feel like dealing with the fiddling anymore. With Linux projects, it's different for me. I almost expect it to be difficult, and it's fine with me because in general it's open source and I heavily benefit from the hard work from others. So, I spent countless hours trying to set up a WLAN access point on a Raspi that is connected to my network via LAN and brings the connected devices into the network via VPN. (My regular router can't do this, and I have one or two devices that I'd like to connect to the network via VPN, but I can't install a client on them.) I ultimately failed and gave up a few weeks ago. Last week, I stumbled across the [BerylAX GL-MT3000](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-mt3000/) and it took me no more than 5 minutes to get it up and running with [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/). This really blew me away.\n\n- ⏺️ The [Stream Deck Neo](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/stream-deck-neo) was announced and looks really compelling to me.\n\n- 📺 Continued watching [Palm Royale](https://trakt.tv/shows/palm-royale/seasons/1/episodes/1) - still not sure about this TV series.\n\n- 🎥 Watch [Riders of Justice](https://trakt.tv/movies/riders-of-justice-2020) - enjoyed that one.\n\n- 🕹️ Spent way too much money for discounted games on Steam and played a lot of [Dead Cells](https://deadcells.com). Really hard but I like it a lot.[^3]\n\nHave a nice week! 🙋‍♂️\n\n[^1]: BTW I wouldn't be surprised if Apple's spontaneous change of direction regarding emulators was related to the AltStore PAL to take some wind out of the sails of the alternative app store, but maybe I'm going too far with that. Perhaps others can unravel this.\n\n[^2]: This paragraph was obviously inspired by a section of [Clockwise](https://podcasts.apple.com/de/podcast/clockwise/id665964031?i=1000652770646).\n\n[^3]: BTW as of writing this, Dead Cells is no longer on sale on steam but for Nintendo Switch. So, if you own one, go and check it out.\n\n",

(Doom actually had a big impact on me during my school years.)\n\n- 📷 Also not a novel, but already noted, a new Take Control Book: [Take Control of iPhone Photography](https://www.takecontrolbooks.com/iphone-photography/).\n\n- ✍️ I couldn't resist playing with [Vincent](https://vincentritter.com)'s [Scribbles](https://scribbles.page); I \"secretly\" played with a small [side project](https://apps.icymi.lol) there, which Habit immediately [discovered](https://mastodon.social/@habibcham/112173355622816543).\n\n- 💻 Alongside [Rectangle Pro](https://rectangleapp.com/pro) and [Superkey](https://superkey.app/), I started trying out another app by [Ryan Hanson](https://ryanhanson.dev/): [Charmstone](https://charmstone.app/) - *The quicker switcher launcher for macOS*.\n\n- 🖥️ I asked on Mastodon for Terminal alternatives and three were mainly mentioned: [Warp: Your terminal, reimagined](https://www.warp.dev/),  [WezTerm - Wez's Terminal Emulator](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html), and [iTerm2 - macOS Terminal Replacement](https://iterm2.com/). I haven't had the chance yet, but hopefully, I will be able to take a closer look at them over the next week(s).\n\n- 🎮 I was not aware of how easy it can be on macOS to get Windows games purchased from the Epic Game Store or GOG to run: [Heroic Games Launcher](https://heroicgameslauncher.com/) - *An Open Source Epic, GOG, and Amazon Prime Games Launcher*.\n\n- Speaking of games: Played [Slice & Dice](https://tann.itch.io/slice-dice) and [Balatro](https://www.playbalatro.com). (It's all [Daniel Santos](https://danielsantos.org/blog/week-12-2024/)' fault! 😎)\n\n- 🛠️ [Chris Hannah](https://chrishannah.me/) released a [CLI Tool to Post to Micro.Blog](https://chrishannah.me/projects/2024/pst-a-cli-tool-to-post-to-microblog/).\n\n- 🌱 Spring is coming and we took this as an opportunity to completely reseed our lawn; it was more of a field than a lawn and therefore urgently needed; we are curious to see if it will turn out well.\n\n- 📺 No television, no movies, no series in the last two weeks.\n\nHave a pleasant week ahead!\n\n[^1]: I thought I'd start with a Stephen King novel since his books always captivated me in the past; however, I was not so convinced by Holly; the book is quite repetitive and long-winded.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I hope I'll stay firm and wait at least for Gen 2 and not want to buy it as soon as the AVP is available in Germany. However, I still find this video noteworthy: [What Reviewers Aren’t Telling You About Apple Vision Pro](https://youtube.com/watch?v=eOH33sWgds8).\n\n- 😤 [Gruber's polemics](https://social.lol/@esamecar/111945573099378265) and [European Union bashing](https://daringfireball.net/2024/02/eu_rcs_imessage) are getting on my nerves.

Although, it seems to be just the beginning of something really big to come due to its many existing <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/the_vision_pro\">shortcomings</a> (weight, battery life, bulkiness, price etc.). Therefore, the device is more of a vision what Spatial Computing could be like in the future. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if, in a few years, we could wear cheaper and especially much lighter and smaller glasses that discreetly answer all our questions anywhere or project a cinema screen in front of our faces, even though we&rsquo;re sitting on a <a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=UvkgmyfMPks\">bench on the Times Square</a>?

				"content_text": "\nAfter [reading](https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price) and [watching](https://youtube.com/watch?v=GkPw6ScHyb4) selected reports about the Apple Vision Pro, the consensus seems to be that the experience is absolutely unique. Although, it seems to be just the beginning of something really big to come due to its many existing [shortcomings](https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/the_vision_pro) (weight, battery life, bulkiness, price etc.). Therefore, the device is more of a vision what Spatial Computing could be like in the future. Wouldn't it be great if, in a few years, we could wear cheaper and especially much lighter and smaller glasses that discreetly answer all our questions anywhere or project a cinema screen in front of our faces, even though we're sitting on a [bench on the Times Square](https://youtube.com/watch?v=UvkgmyfMPks)? Similar to how the iPhone initially had a number of shortcomings (price, EDGE, no copy and paste, no app store, no video recording, poor camera, etc.) that have now been almost completely eliminated, the next few years will also provide a far better Spatial Computing experience.\n\nHowever, I wonder whether this will really be the case with the Apple Vision Pro, or whether we will only see improved versions of the current hardware in the foreseeable future, but no radical shift or further development that the reviewers / YouTubers are dreaming of.[^1] Will it really be possible to project non-transparent objects into our eyes without completely shielding them from ambient light? But as long as this is not the case, we will have to continue walking around[^2] with far too large, bulky, ski goggles tailored exactly to the wearer's face, and no, this is definitely not the future I want to experience.\n\n[^1]: I mean, the iPhone and the Apple Watch have definitely improved a lot over the years, but fundamentally neither of these two devices has evolved from the first version into a new dimension.\n[^2]: I actually mean exactly that - walking around. I can already see the great potential of the Vision Pro when you're more or less in one place (couch, workplace), but I wonder whether the vision of \"everyone wearing one of these devices everywhere and at all times\" can actually be realized with this concept.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Continuing from week <a href=\"https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/01/28/what-caught-my.html\">04</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the fifth week of 2024:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>🎮 This week I had to repeatedly curb my nearly uncontrollable urge to buy gadgets I don&rsquo;t need - so far quite successfully. I did not order the <a href=\"https://www.ayaneo.com/product/AYANEO-NEXT-LITE.html\">Ayaneo Next LITE</a> nor pledged the <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ayaneo-flip-world-1st-dual-screen-windows-handheld--2#/\">Ayaneo Flip - World 1st Dual-Screen Windows Handheld</a> on Indiegogo. I definitely do not need more gaming handhelds at the moment, even though I don&rsquo;t own one that supports Windows games yet. My backlog is already long enough, I don&rsquo;t need another platform with even more games that I will never play. <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🕹️ One of the games therein is <a href=\"https://exok.com/games/celeste/\">Celeste</a> for the Switch or Playstation. It <a href=\"https://retrododo.com/celeste-64/\">seems to be an absolute classic</a> and I only know the version for the <a href=\"https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=2145\">pico-8</a>, where it all started. It&rsquo;s really hard and so far I can&rsquo;t even get past the third (or fourth?) screen. Regardless, there is now a version as a homage to the N64 area: <a href=\"https://maddymakesgamesinc.itch.io/celeste64\">Celeste 64: Fragments of the Mountain by Maddy Makes Games, Heidy Motta, Noel, saint11</a>. Unfortunately not yet for the Mac, but in the comments you could already read that it is technically quite possible and probably will come.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🖥️ Speaking of gaming on the Mac: This week <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/death-stranding-directors-cut/id6449748961\">Death Stranding Director&rsquo;s Cut</a> was released. I hadn&rsquo;t dealt with the game so far, I don&rsquo;t know either the original version for the PS4 or the Director&rsquo;s Cut for the PS5. Unlike Resident Evil 4, which recently appeared for Apple&rsquo;s devices, this was an opportunity to get an AAA game for macOS at a reasonable price that I hadn&rsquo;t played before. And wow, I am absolutely impressed by the graphics on my MacBook Pro M2 so far. Holy shit, I mean, wow. So far I was not considering a Mac being able to do such a thing. Whether the actual game will appeal to me, I still have to find out, but as a tech demo it has definitely already picked me up. To be able to play it better, I bought a <a href=\"https://www.8bitdo.com/pro2/\">Pro 2 Controller</a> from 8BitDo. At first I despaired of their product portfolio, <sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> and then I realized that I could have used an old PS4 controller. Well, what can you do. I guess, now I am not only somehow collecting retro handhelds, but also game controllers &hellip;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>⏱️ The release of Death Stranding was well timed, as I finished the story of Diablo IV after about 56 hours of playtime this week. I can note for myself that I always take about twice as long for a game as indicated on <a href=\"https://howlongtobeat.com/game/71960\">HowLongToBeat</a> 🤷‍♂️. My Rogue is now level 49 and I will definitely tackle the end game again, at least until I reach level 50 with her. I enjoyed the game, but Diablo IV did not 100% convince me. At first it overwhelmed me with its complexity and its own language for all the facets of the game. The whole system seems unnecessarily complicated to me and later the gameplay became quiet repetitive. And all this in-game loot box up sell shit really got on my nerves. I mean, you buy a full price game and then you&rsquo;re constantly being thrown  pointless IAPs for up to 150 € in your face. Seriously?! Anyway, in the next few weeks I think I will focus again on Super Marios Bros. 3 (GBA) on my <a href=\"https://www.analogue.co\">Analogue</a> Pocket and look maybe at smaller indie titles on the console at most. Then I see if I enjoy Death Stranding. Maybe I&rsquo;ll understand the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QLq2k22AB0\">trailer for part 2</a> better afterwards?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🎮 BTW what definitely interests me more than a Windows handheld is the now possibly upcoming Switch 2 this year and I found the rumors that <a href=\"https://retrododo.com/ps-vitas-successor-is-reportedly-on-the-way/\">The PS Vita&rsquo;s Successor Is Reportedly On The Way &amp; Compatible With PS4/PS5 Titles</a> interesting, too.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>📱 I also did not give in to my impulse to pre-order a rabbit <a href=\"https://www.rabbit.tech/\">r1 - your pocket companion</a>. I find the r1 very exciting as a concept study. I like the design, which comes from the <a href=\"https://teenage.engineering\">same pen</a> as the <a href=\"https://play.date\">playdate</a>. However, the r1 would not be delivered to Europe until the second half of the year anyways, and if the rumors are true, hopefully a usable AI will also be included in <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/01/tim-cook-apple-ai-ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> in the fall. Ultimately, of course, something like this belongs in the smartphone, and I therefore see the r1 at best as a cute gimmick, without a real future. But that&rsquo;s not a reason not to have fun with a toy, is it?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>💻 If I understood correctly, the r1 uses <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai\">perplexity.ai</a>, about which I have read a lot of good things lately. Therefore, I wanted to take a closer look at this service, but their Cloudflare configuration initially did not want to <a href=\"https://social.lol/@esamecar/111861940258698097\">let me play along</a> with Safari 🤷‍♂️. I don&rsquo;t know what exactly Cloudflare didn&rsquo;t like, the check also came with the Arc browser, but disappeared after some time. I&rsquo;m not really convinced yet, but I definitely need to use the service more to form a final opinion.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🌐 Speaking of <a href=\"https://arc.net\">Arc Browser</a>, I suspect that <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/arc-search/id6472513080\"> Arc Search</a> also uses <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai\">perplexity.ai</a>, especially since it can be configured as the default search engine in Arc. I am still not 100% convinced by the browser, either. It all seems a bit strange and opaque to me (why do I need an account to surf the web?!) <sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup> and I find the browser itself quite sluggish and already a  bit bloated. I also don&rsquo;t know what to make of this <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/news/the-browser-company-announces-act-ii-for-arc-the-browser-that-browses-for-you/\">Act II</a>. Anyway, there were very <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/arc-search-for-iphone/\">enthusiastic reports</a> about Arc Search, but the app hasn&rsquo;t really picked me up yet by now. I will force myself to use it more often in the next few days in order to be able to form a better opinion.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🚀 I stumbled upon this post in my RSS Reader - <a href=\"https://www.blast-o-rama.com/2024/01/30/the-iconfactory-looks-to-launch-project-tapestry-via-kickstarter/\">The Iconfactory Looks To Launch PROJECT TAPESTRY via Kickstarter</a> - and more or less backed the <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iconfactory/project-tapestry\">Early Bird Special</a> immediately: <em>With Project Tapestry, we&rsquo;ll create a universal, chronological timeline for iOS for any data that’s publicly available on the Internet.</em> Who doesn&rsquo;t like the guys from <a href=\"https://iconfactory.com\">The Iconfactory</a> and after the whole Twitter debacle a year ago, I&rsquo;m happy to support the developers. I&rsquo;m curious to see if an app will ultimately come out that I find useful, and if not, at least I was able to follow the development and had access to some nice <a href=\"https://wallaroo.app\">wallpapers</a> for a year 🤷‍♂️. Not coincidentally, <a href=\"https://gloria.social/@rizzi/111856959119832404\">Silvio Rizzi</a> announced his new app a few days later: <em>A new app, completely rebuilt and rethought from the ground up. This probably won’t replace the current Reeder (not going away) for a lot of users.</em> He also didn&rsquo;t miss the opportunity to show Project Tapestry directly in his screenshot 😈.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🧹 This little app from <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@_inside\">Gui Rambo</a> <em>helps you clean your Mac&rsquo;s keyboard and trackpad</em>: <a href=\"https://cleanupbuddy.app/\">CleanupBuddy</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>📎 As announced <a href=\"https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/01/28/what-caught-my.html\">last week</a>, I took a look at <a href=\"https://www.witt-software.com/linkcluster/\">Link Cluster</a> - <em>Collect and manage links</em>. In principle, I like the app, but it yet lacks the ability to copy links as Markdown links, and that alone is a reason for me to stick with <a href=\"https://anybox.app/\">Anybox</a> for now. Therefore, I have not yet bought the full version and cannot assess how Link Cluster handles large bookmark collections. But I will definitely continue to follow the development of the app.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🎥 I stumbled upon this at the beginning of the week on <a href=\"https://waxy.org\">Waxy.org</a> and am surprised that it is still online: <a href=\"https://ascii.theater/\">ASCII Theater</a> - <em>stream free-text-based movies-in your-terminal</em>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I was very happy and honoured that <a href=\"https://social.lol/@mihobu\">Michael</a> included my little site in his <a href=\"https://mihobu.lol/blogroll\">blogroll</a>. I also enjoy reading his posts a lot, so its mutual. I also need to revise my own <a href=\"https://mb.esamecar.net/blogroll/\">blogroll</a>, I just have to find the time to do it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>📵 At the beginning of the year, I had resolved to give up certain things for a few months, each for a month. In January, I started with giving up alcohol and today I realized that it is already February. My problem now is that all the things I had thought of not doing for February, I have already done in the last three days 🤦‍♂️. Now what?! I think I just have to spend February without consuming alcohol as well and prepare better for March 🤣 On my list of ideas is also &ldquo;A month without a smartphone&rdquo; or &ldquo;A month without an Apple Watch&rdquo;. That seems too crazy to me right now, and maybe I&rsquo;ll combine it into a &ldquo;A month less gadgets&rdquo; and give up my iPhone or my watch for &ldquo;only&rdquo; a week each, like Arne did with his <a href=\"https://arne.me/articles/i-lived-7-days-without-a-smartphone\">phone</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>😂 When I read this, I had to laugh a lot:<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup> <a href=\"https://www.heise.de/news/Deutsche-Bahn-sucht-Admin-fuer-Windows-3-11-for-Workgroups-9611543.html\">Deutsche Bahn sucht Admin für Windows 3.11 for Workgroups</a>, which means &ldquo;Deutsche Bahn is looking for an Admin for Windows 3.11 for Workgroups&rdquo; and immediately thought of <a href=\"https://norden.social/@racemase/111341692772365841\">my photo</a> which I took in one of our, oh so modern, ICE trains last November.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>📚 I stumbled upon this at <a href=\"https://heydingus.net/blog/2024/1/7-things-this-week-129\">Hey Dingus</a>: <a href=\"https://www.perry.qa/morse\">Learn Morse Code</a>. I would also like to learn something like this. But first, I should probably start refreshing the tying of various <a href=\"https://www.animatedknots.com/\">knots</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🍪 I printed a very large <a href=\"https://www.printables.com/de/model/658952-giant-oreo-container\">Oreo cookie</a>. It weighs (not just a feeling) a good half kilogram, consists of six parts, has hardly any space inside but is absolutely awesome. In addition, I printed a <a href=\"https://www.printables.com/de/model/56004-homepod-mini-stand\">HomePod Mini stand</a> for ours in the kitchen. This way it might survive a disaster better. I also like this <a href=\"https://www.printables.com/de/model/518689-apple-watch-stand\">Apple Watch Stand</a> and while I was at it, I also printed <a href=\"https://www.printables.com/de/model/423218-snes-cartridge-holder-pal\">SNES Cartridge Holder (PAL)</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.printables.com/de/model/512566-n64-single-cartridge-display-stand\">N64 Single Cartridge Display Stand</a> for my Super Mario cartridges.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🖨️ The next project for my <a href=\"https://www.ankermake.com/eu-en/m5?ref=naviMenu_2_2_img\">AnkerMake M5</a> is to take a closer look at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra_9zU-mnl8\">Gridfinity</a>. It seems to me to be a <a href=\"https://gridfinity.xyz\">nice system</a>. Now I just need to figure out which base plates I can best use.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>💻 This week I wanted to use a VPN connection with a device that is only WLAN capable. Since there is no way to set up a VPN service directly on the device, I thought it should be easy to make my Mac&rsquo;s VPN connection available to other devices via WLAN Sharing. Well, far from it. Basically, it seems to be possible somehow, but unfortunately not with the help of <a href=\"https://nordvpn.com/\">NordVPN</a>, my until now used VPN provider 😢.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>👌 In the Apple universe, of course, the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a> was the event of the week. The usual suspects have already <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/the_vision_pro\">written</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price\">published videos</a> extensively about it. As a European, I will thankfully not be confronted with the question of whether it might be worth the money for me in the next couple months. Basically, I am of course extremely fascinated and would give a lot to be able to try it out. Especially the entertainment aspect appeals to me, because my better half only tolerates a tiny 32&quot; TV in the living room, <sup id=\"fnref:5\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">5</a></sup> and not only having a home cinema, but a whole iMAX cinema in my own four walls, of course appears extremely tempting. However, I am also not sure what would happen if I used a VisionPro at home in her presence, I at least only dared to use the PS VR 1 when she was out &hellip; 🤷‍♂️</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>📝 Last but not least, <a href=\"https://mas.to/@obsidian/111863007663904581\">Obsidian</a> now also offers servers outside the USA. I therefore moved my private Obsidian vault to a European server and immediately imagine that the synchronization is faster. Apart from that, I find it better anyway to know my data in a European data center.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>📺 Continued watching <a href=\"https://trakt.tv/shows/for-all-mankind/seasons/4\">For All Mankind</a> S4 with my wife. I enjoy this TV show but it definitely does not make you happy or confident.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>Buying computer games is also a kind of <a href=\"https://social.lol/@esamecar/111846076008240616\">addiction for me</a>.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>I find it very confusing and difficult to find out which controller fits with which device how.

				"content_text": "\nContinuing from week [04](https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/01/28/what-caught-my.html), here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the fifth week of 2024:\n\n- 🎮 This week I had to repeatedly curb my nearly uncontrollable urge to buy gadgets I don't need - so far quite successfully. I did not order the [Ayaneo Next LITE](https://www.ayaneo.com/product/AYANEO-NEXT-LITE.html) nor pledged the [Ayaneo Flip - World 1st Dual-Screen Windows Handheld](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ayaneo-flip-world-1st-dual-screen-windows-handheld--2#/) on Indiegogo. I definitely do not need more gaming handhelds at the moment, even though I don't own one that supports Windows games yet. My backlog is already long enough, I don't need another platform with even more games that I will never play. [^1]\n\n- 🕹️ One of the games therein is [Celeste](https://exok.com/games/celeste/) for the Switch or Playstation. It [seems to be an absolute classic](https://retrododo.com/celeste-64/) and I only know the version for the [pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=2145), where it all started. It's really hard and so far I can't even get past the third (or fourth?) screen. Regardless, there is now a version as a homage to the N64 area: [Celeste 64: Fragments of the Mountain by Maddy Makes Games, Heidy Motta, Noel, saint11](https://maddymakesgamesinc.itch.io/celeste64). Unfortunately not yet for the Mac, but in the comments you could already read that it is technically quite possible and probably will come.\n\n- 🖥️ Speaking of gaming on the Mac: This week [Death Stranding Director's Cut](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/death-stranding-directors-cut/id6449748961) was released. I hadn't dealt with the game so far, I don't know either the original version for the PS4 or the Director's Cut for the PS5.

Then I see if I enjoy Death Stranding. Maybe I'll understand the [trailer for part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QLq2k22AB0) better afterwards?\n\n- 🎮 BTW what definitely interests me more than a Windows handheld is the now possibly upcoming Switch 2 this year and I found the rumors that [The PS Vita's Successor Is Reportedly On The Way & Compatible With PS4/PS5 Titles](https://retrododo.com/ps-vitas-successor-is-reportedly-on-the-way/) interesting, too.\n\n- 📱 I also did not give in to my impulse to pre-order a rabbit [r1 - your pocket companion](https://www.rabbit.tech/). I find the r1 very exciting as a concept study. I like the design, which comes from the [same pen](https://teenage.engineering) as the [playdate](https://play.date). However, the r1 would not be delivered to Europe until the second half of the year anyways, and if the rumors are true, hopefully a usable AI will also be included in [iOS 18](https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/01/tim-cook-apple-ai-ios-18/) in the fall. Ultimately, of course, something like this belongs in the smartphone, and I therefore see the r1 at best as a cute gimmick, without a real future. But that's not a reason not to have fun with a toy, is it?\n\n- 💻 If I understood correctly, the r1 uses [perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai), about which I have read a lot of good things lately. Therefore, I wanted to take a closer look at this service, but their Cloudflare configuration initially did not want to [let me play along](https://social.lol/@esamecar/111861940258698097) with Safari 🤷‍♂️. I don't know what exactly Cloudflare didn't like, the check also came with the Arc browser, but disappeared after some time. I'm not really convinced yet, but I definitely need to use the service more to form a final opinion.\n\n- 🌐 Speaking of [Arc Browser](https://arc.net), I suspect that [ Arc Search](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/arc-search/id6472513080) also uses [perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai), especially since it can be configured as the default search engine in Arc. I am still not 100% convinced by the browser, either. It all seems a bit strange and opaque to me (why do I need an account to surf the web?!) [^2] and I find the browser itself quite sluggish and already a  bit bloated. I also don't know what to make of this [Act II](https://www.macstories.net/news/the-browser-company-announces-act-ii-for-arc-the-browser-that-browses-for-you/). Anyway, there were very [enthusiastic reports](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/arc-search-for-iphone/) about Arc Search, but the app hasn't really picked me up yet by now. I will force myself to use it more often in the next few days in order to be able to form a better opinion.\n\n- 🚀 I stumbled upon this post in my RSS Reader - [The Iconfactory Looks To Launch PROJECT TAPESTRY via Kickstarter](https://www.blast-o-rama.com/2024/01/30/the-iconfactory-looks-to-launch-project-tapestry-via-kickstarter/) - and more or less backed the [Early Bird Special](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iconfactory/project-tapestry) immediately: *With Project Tapestry, we'll create a universal, chronological timeline for iOS for any data that’s publicly available on the Internet.* Who doesn't like the guys from [The Iconfactory](https://iconfactory.com) and after the whole Twitter debacle a year ago, I'm happy to support the developers. I'm curious to see if an app will ultimately come out that I find useful, and if not, at least I was able to follow the development and had access to some nice [wallpapers](https://wallaroo.app) for a year 🤷‍♂️. Not coincidentally, [Silvio Rizzi](https://gloria.social/@rizzi/111856959119832404) announced his new app a few days later: *A new app, completely rebuilt and rethought from the ground up. This probably won’t replace the current Reeder (not going away) for a lot of users.* He also didn't miss the opportunity to show Project Tapestry directly in his screenshot 😈.\n\n- 🧹 This little app from [Gui Rambo](https://mastodon.social/@_inside) *helps you clean your Mac's keyboard and trackpad*: [CleanupBuddy](https://cleanupbuddy.app/).\n\n- 📎 As announced [last week](https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/01/28/what-caught-my.html), I took a look at [Link Cluster](https://www.witt-software.com/linkcluster/) - *Collect and manage links*. In principle, I like the app, but it yet lacks the ability to copy links as Markdown links, and that alone is a reason for me to stick with [Anybox](https://anybox.app/) for now. Therefore, I have not yet bought the full version and cannot assess how Link Cluster handles large bookmark collections. But I will definitely continue to follow the development of the app.\n\n- 🎥 I stumbled upon this at the beginning of the week on [Waxy.org](https://waxy.org) and am surprised that it is still online: [ASCII Theater](https://ascii.theater/) - *stream free-text-based movies-in your-terminal*.\n\n- I was very happy and honoured that [Michael](https://social.lol/@mihobu) included my little site in his [blogroll](https://mihobu.lol/blogroll). I also enjoy reading his posts a lot, so its mutual. I also need to revise my own [blogroll](https://mb.esamecar.net/blogroll/), I just have to find the time to do it.\n\n- 📵 At the beginning of the year, I had resolved to give up certain things for a few months, each for a month. In January, I started with giving up alcohol and today I realized that it is already February. My problem now is that all the things I had thought of not doing for February, I have already done in the last three days 🤦‍♂️. Now what?! I think I just have to spend February without consuming alcohol as well and prepare better for March 🤣 On my list of ideas is also \"A month without a smartphone\" or \"A month without an Apple Watch\". That seems too crazy to me right now, and maybe I'll combine it into a \"A month less gadgets\" and give up my iPhone or my watch for \"only\" a week each, like Arne did with his [phone](https://arne.me/articles/i-lived-7-days-without-a-smartphone).\n\n- 😂 When I read this, I had to laugh a lot:[^3] [Deutsche Bahn sucht Admin für Windows 3.11 for Workgroups](https://www.heise.de/news/Deutsche-Bahn-sucht-Admin-fuer-Windows-3-11-for-Workgroups-9611543.html), which means \"Deutsche Bahn is looking for an Admin for Windows 3.11 for Workgroups\" and immediately thought of [my photo](https://norden.social/@racemase/111341692772365841) which I took in one of our, oh so modern, ICE trains last November.\n\n- 📚 I stumbled upon this at [Hey Dingus](https://heydingus.net/blog/2024/1/7-things-this-week-129): [Learn Morse Code](https://www.perry.qa/morse). I would also like to learn something like this. But first, I should probably start refreshing the tying of various [knots](https://www.animatedknots.com/).\n\n- 🍪 I printed a very large [Oreo cookie](https://www.printables.com/de/model/658952-giant-oreo-container). It weighs (not just a feeling) a good half kilogram, consists of six parts, has hardly any space inside but is absolutely awesome. In addition, I printed a [HomePod Mini stand](https://www.printables.com/de/model/56004-homepod-mini-stand) for ours in the kitchen. This way it might survive a disaster better. I also like this [Apple Watch Stand](https://www.printables.com/de/model/518689-apple-watch-stand) and while I was at it, I also printed [SNES Cartridge Holder (PAL)](https://www.printables.com/de/model/423218-snes-cartridge-holder-pal) and the [N64 Single Cartridge Display Stand](https://www.printables.com/de/model/512566-n64-single-cartridge-display-stand) for my Super Mario cartridges.\n\n- 🖨️ The next project for my [AnkerMake M5](https://www.ankermake.com/eu-en/m5?ref=naviMenu_2_2_img) is to take a closer look at [Gridfinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra_9zU-mnl8). It seems to me to be a [nice system](https://gridfinity.xyz). Now I just need to figure out which base plates I can best use.\n\n- 💻 This week I wanted to use a VPN connection with a device that is only WLAN capable. Since there is no way to set up a VPN service directly on the device, I thought it should be easy to make my Mac's VPN connection available to other devices via WLAN Sharing. Well, far from it. Basically, it seems to be possible somehow, but unfortunately not with the help of [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/), my until now used VPN provider 😢.\n\n- 👌 In the Apple universe, of course, the launch of the [Apple Vision Pro](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/) was the event of the week. The usual suspects have already [written](https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/the_vision_pro) or [published videos](https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price) extensively about it. As a European, I will thankfully not be confronted with the question of whether it might be worth the money for me in the next couple months. Basically, I am of course extremely fascinated and would give a lot to be able to try it out. Especially the entertainment aspect appeals to me, because my better half only tolerates a tiny 32\" TV in the living room, [^4] and not only having a home cinema, but a whole iMAX cinema in my own four walls, of course appears extremely tempting. However, I am also not sure what would happen if I used a VisionPro at home in her presence, I at least only dared to use the PS VR 1 when she was out ... 🤷‍♂️\n\n- 📝 Last but not least, [Obsidian](https://mas.to/@obsidian/111863007663904581) now also offers servers outside the USA. I therefore moved my private Obsidian vault to a European server and immediately imagine that the synchronization is faster. Apart from that, I find it better anyway to know my data in a European data center.\n\n- 📺 Continued watching [For All Mankind](https://trakt.tv/shows/for-all-mankind/seasons/4) S4 with my wife. I enjoy this TV show but it definitely does not make you happy or confident.\n\n[^1]: Buying computer games is also a kind of [addiction for me](https://social.lol/@esamecar/111846076008240616).\n[^2]: Is that still the case? 🤔\n[^3]: Actually, it's much too sad, but by now I have come to terms with the fact that I live in a country where a lot, a lot is broken and only a few people believe we are at the forefront of anything or really good at it.\n[^4]: But I was allowed to buy a projector and a portable screen for shared movie nights.\n[^5]: I find it very confusing and difficult to find out which controller fits with which device how. Especially since some are listed as not compatible with the Mac, but can pretend to be a Switch controller, which macOS usually recognizes without problems.\n\n",

You can either get a $600 discount for an as yet unannounced product, or they will refund the paid money. I&rsquo;ve opted for a $330 refund. Although it&rsquo;s a pity, I think it was the right decision for Anker to pull the plug on this product. My M5 already has problems with just one filament; getting the printer to work reliably with 6 print heads was probably indeed an unsolvable task.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>📚 I had resolved to read more books this year.

				"content_text": "\nIn continuation of week [02](https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/01/14/what-caught-my.html), here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the third week of 2024:\n\n- 🖨️ Almost 2 years after Anker introduced its V6 Color Engine for the [M5 3D printer](https://www.ankermake.com/uk/m5), it [cancelled it](https://all3dp.com/4/ankermake-pulls-plug-on-v6-multicolor-add-on-to-refund-backers/). You can either get a $600 discount for an as yet unannounced product, or they will refund the paid money. I've opted for a $330 refund. Although it's a pity, I think it was the right decision for Anker to pull the plug on this product. My M5 already has problems with just one filament; getting the printer to work reliably with 6 print heads was probably indeed an unsolvable task.\n\n- 📚 I had resolved to read more books this year. I have finished [one](https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/01/15/finished-reading-die.html) so far, although I probably started it over ten months ago and have only now finally completed it. Instead of reading one of the countless hardcover books owned by my wife, I wanted to start with *Holly* as an eBook. But on the iPhone, despite Focus Modes etc., I get distracted far too easily, so I bought a [PocketBook Era](https://pocketbook.de/de_en/pocketbook-era-stardust-silver) (with a 20% discount).

It actually made the year 2023 better, although otherwise, it wasn&rsquo;t really a year I look back on with much joy. <strong>So, I wish everyone a Happy New Year, stay healthy, and see you soon.

On Reddit, there are some simpler versions available for free ([Original](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fmade-a-lock-screen-wallpaper-of-the-iconic-first-gen-ipod-v0-61b5kun81gd91.jpg%3Fwidth%3D640%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Dacffa8bc4b6181abb6a21a723f37755b3ebda938&rdt=44250), [iPod Mini](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fios-16-in-mind-lock-screen-wallpapers-of-the-legendary-ipod-v0-9ww5016zbkd91.jpg%3Fwidth%3D640%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D47efddb8c0bdc9d1f6ccb5d15d8f891e65c47075)), and moreover, Basic Apple Guy has recently released some very nice ones, [Aurora Gradient](https://basicappleguy.com/haberdashery/auroraborealisgradient) and [Ugly Christmas Sweater Wallpapers (Mac Edition)](https://basicappleguy.com/basicappleblog/ugly-christmas-sweater-wallpapers-mac-edition), and just published his [Rewind 2023: Wallpapers](https://basicappleguy.com/basicappleblog/rewind-2023-wallpapers).\n\n- 📝 [Blake](https://social.lol/@bw) released a web app for omg.lol: [write.omg.lol](https://write.omg.lol/) - *A simple notepad in your browser backed by omg.lol's Pastebin feature*.\n\n- 🖥️ Found this on [baty.net](https://baty.net/journal/2023/12/27/using-setapp-versions-of-apps): [So you got Setapp… make the most of it](https://brettterpstra.com/2019/04/22/so-you-got-setapp-dot-dot-dot-make-the-most-of-it/): A Terminal script, \"*which will tell you what apps you have that also have a Setapp version*\". This way you can \"*contribute part of the monthly subscription fee you’re already paying to the developers of the apps you love*\".\n\n- ✏️ [Canion](https://social.lol/@canion) posted about another nice-looking plain text/markdown note-taking app I had never heard of before: [Notebooks](https://www.notebooksapp.com). I now use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) with its [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin and [Actions for Obsidian](https://actions.work/actions-for-obsidian) so intensively that I can't imagine switching, but in principle, native macOS/iOS apps of this kind are extremely welcome.\n\n- 🎵 Installed [Tuneful](https://github.com/martinfekete10/Tuneful) - *a native macOS menu bar playback control app for Spotify and Apple Music*.\n\n- 🖊️ [Sindre Sorhus](https://sindresorhus.com/) has released just another new app: [Memo Widget](https://sindresorhus.com/memo-widget) - *Sticky notes on your Home Screen, Lock Screen, and desktop*.\n\n- 🎉 [KeyJerk Reactions](https://github.com/x74353/KeyJerk-Reactions) lets you bind the new macOS' Video reactions via a nice UI or a script.\n\n- 🔗 Bookmarked [SharePal](https://getsharepal.app) - *Lightning speed sharing. Add. Organize. Share*. I don't have a specific use case for this app yet, but should it come to that, I now have an idea of how I could make the task easier.\n\n- 🌏 This one looks interesting: [‎Globetrotter](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/globetrotter-travel-tracker/id6469319235) - \"*a location-based travel photos app, providing a fast and fun way to share your travel highlights with your friends and family*\". Now I just need to get around more, which is not so easy for a household that doesn't own a car and for some reason doesn't fly.\n\n- 📱 Additional apps for iOS, many of which with a free lifetime license thanks to the Indie App Santa promotion: [Cheatsheet](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cheatsheet-notes-widget/id914665829), [Joy](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chatbot-assistant-joy-ai/id6447106829), [Keybot](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ai-keyboard-assistant-keybot/id1663671666), [Mindr](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mindr-erinnern-ohne-stress/id6451364783), [Peaks](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/peaks-biorhythm-tracker/id6446705377), [Photo Route](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photo-route-map-your-photos/id6444888265), [Pretty Progress](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/countdown-pretty-progress/id1597616326), and [Replica](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/screen-mirroring-cast-mirror/id1468495939). It remains to be seen which of these I will actually use on a regular basis.[^1]\n\n- 📱 I installed [‎finity](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/finity/id1071698434) on my iPhone and enjoyed playing it now and then during some trips over the Christmas holidays.\n\n- 🎮 Finished [Super Mario Advance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros._2#Super_Mario_Advance) (Super Mario Bros. 2 port for GBA) on my [Analogue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co).\n\n- 😈 Started playing [Diablo 4](https://diablo4.blizzard.com/de-de/). I absolutely do not understand yet what one has to do here and especially when and why, but I enjoy it so far ;-)\n\n- 🕹 I checked out [‎Resident Evil 4](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/resident-evil-4/id6462360082) on my M2 MacBook Pro and was pleasantly surprised at how well and smoothly it plays. I imagine I see clear differences to the PS5 version I already own, but if I didn't, it could have been a good purchase for the Mac as well. (I'm not sure if it's such a clever idea to sell games that have been available for established gaming consoles for years to \"real\" gamers, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed for Apple.)\n\n- 🤖 Funko Box- So many of them almost everywhere. Awesome; did not let [Microsoft Designer](https://designer.microsoft.com/image-creator?p=Funko+figure+of+a+male%2C+smiling%2C+called+%5BFrank+Meeuwsen%5D%2C+wearing+%5Bglasses%2C+a+yellow+and+brown+flannel+Vans+shirt%2C+dark+blue+Levis+501+jeans+%5Dand+%5BBlack+Vans+skater+shoes%5D%2C+%5Bclean+cut+hair%5D%2C+%5Ba+medium+long+black+beard+with+touches+of+grey+in+the+front%5D.+The+Funko+is+displayed+%5Binside+and+outside%5D+a+limited+edition+%5Bgreen+and+yellow%5D+Funko+box+with+%5BBlogger%5D+text%2C+allowing+visibility+of+the+figure%2C+typography%2C+3D+render.+%5BWhite%5D+background) create my own, though.\n\n- 💿 I've signed up to [Album Of The Day](https://1001albumsgenerator.com/esamecar) and enjoy the daily recommendations so far.\n\n- 🎙 I've deleted Overcast and moved to Apple Podcasts.app. Just added only a few shows back in. I'll try to listen to less Podcasts at 1,0 x speed and more music. \n\n- 📖 I read the countless annual reviews and outlooks[^2] with great interest and was pleased about the (perceived) [renaissance of blogging](https://rknight.me/blog/the-web-is-fantastic/). Of course, a large part of this was due to [Rob's App Defaults](https://defaults.rknight.me) overview page, which now offers > 300 individual blogs as RSS feeds for simple import into your own feed reader.\n\n- 🥰 Speaking of it, my [Hemispheric Views](https://hemisphericviews.com) [Defaults Laptop Sticker](https://hemisphericviews.bigcartel.com/product/hemispheric-views-defaults-laptop-sticker) [arrived](https://social.lol/@esamecar/111619449278404002).\n\n- 🍿 Watched [Barbie (2023)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/346698) with the family. Was fun!\n\n- 🙏 Thank you for reading my Weeknotes in 2023! I didn't quite manage to consistently follow through on the resolution I made at the beginning of the year to write down a few things each week, was briefly on the verge of [giving up](https://esamecar.weblog.lol/2023/11/what-caught-my-attention-in-week-fourty-seven-2023) entirely, and still find it a bit odd, but I had a lot of fun with it. I registered with omg.lol at the beginning of 2023, moved my then only a few weeks old Mastodon account to social.lol, and became a member of micro.blog. I am very happy to have discovered this part of the net. I have actually gotten to know several people who have become dear to me, even though I do not know them personally. Thank you for that! It actually made the year 2023 better, although otherwise, it wasn't really a year I look back on with much joy. **So, I wish everyone a Happy New Year, stay healthy, and see you soon. Looking forward to it!**\n\n\n[^1]: Keybot is definitely pretty high up on the list.\n[^2]: way too many to list them here, sorry 🤷‍♂️\n",

But there are so many nice tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/otaviocc/obsidian-microblog\">Micro Publish</a>, <a href=\"https://redsweater.com/marsedit/\">MarsEdit</a>, and <a href=\"https://ia.net/writer\">iA Writer</a> to publish directly on mb. I&rsquo;ll just put the post on both platforms for now and think about how I will handle this in the future by next week.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>✏️ Speaking of <a href=\"https://ia.net/writer\">iA Writer</a>, a really great editor that I use far too <a href=\"https://social.lol/@esamecar/111506814371408216\">infrequently</a>, was just released in <a href=\"https://ia.net/topics/ia-writer-7\">Version 7</a>.

The <a href=\"https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/099\">last episode</a> of <a href=\"https://listen.hemisphericviews.com\">Hemispheric Views</a> was not as absurdly funny as the <a href=\"https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097\">App Defaults</a> episode, but <a href=\"https://social.lol/@adam\">Adam</a> was a guest. I always find it very interesting to hear what he has to say and am looking forward to his <a href=\"https://home.omg.lol/advent\">25 days of omg.lol</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🖥️ This week at <a href=\"https://indieappsanta.com\">Indie App Santa</a>, <a href=\"https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper\">MacWhisper</a>, probably the best-known Whisper client, was available for free. With <a href=\"https://www.bjnortier.com/2023/11/17/Hello-Transcribe-3.2.html\">Hello Transcribe</a>, there seems to be an alternative that I have not yet tried myself.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🖥️ Also using LLM, but not for transcription, rather for translation, is <a href=\"https://github.com/tisfeng/Easydict\">Easydict</a>: <em>Easydict is a concise and easy-to-use translation dictionary macOS App that allows you to easily and elegantly look up words or translate text.</em> It supports a bunch of different services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>👨‍💻 I started evaluating <a href=\"https://wouter01.github.io/MediaMate/\">MediaMate</a>: <em>Fresh visuals for Volume, Brightness, and Now Playing</em>. It has a nice Notch UI for now playing. Have not tested how it plays together with <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/notchmeister/id1599169747?mt=12\">Notchmeister</a>, though.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🕹 Started playing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stray_%28video_game%29\">Stray</a>. It is a welcome, quite peaceful change after the 100+ hours fighting as <a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west/\">Aloy</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🕹 This week, I actually finished my first Mario game: <a href=\"https://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_Bros._Deluxe\">Super Mario Bros. Deluxe</a> (GBC). I played the cartridge on my <a href=\"https://www.analogue.co/pocket\">Analogue Pocket</a> and thanks to Save States, I have finally managed to see the end credit scene. With every other Mario, I gave up along the way at some point, even though I probably started them all.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🕹 There are not only seemingly 23,342 different retro handhelds, but at least 42 new ones are added every week. I had not heard of the <a href=\"https://evercade.co.uk/exp/\">Evercade EXP</a> until now. You cannot play copies of your own ROMs or original cartridges here, but classics are reissued as cartridges for this system. Interesting concept, and there&rsquo;s even <a href=\"https://evercade.co.uk/cartridges/duke-nukem-collection-1/\">Duke Nukem</a>!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>👰 I found it interesting to read how much <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/01/fake-iphone-computational-photography-glitch\">fuss</a> was made about this one <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/11/30/a-bride-to-be-discovers-a-reality-bending-mistake-in-apples-computational-photography\">bride photo</a>. But probably because we no longer know or can assess what is real at all. I always wonder how my children are supposed to learn which statements in the form of a photo, a video, or an audio recording they can still trust. But that might also be the reason why many people only dive into their own filter bubble and generally dismiss everything as fake news that is too complicated for them or contradicts their own ideas and blindly believe what they want to believe. This is probably actually the biggest challenge we as a society are facing right now, alongside the climate crisis of course.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>👱 Speaking of audio recordings, I couldn&rsquo;t resist having my iPhone create <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/104993\">my own voice</a>. I dutifully read aloud 150 sentences in English. At the beginning, I thought it would never end, but it went quickly towards the end. My iPhone then calculated a lot overnight and the next day I was allowed to try it out. The voice definitely sounds like me. But for my taste, it is significantly too slow. I don&rsquo;t know if this is generally the case or because I tried to speak as clearly as possible in a foreign language. How do people find it whose mother tongue is English? (I generally find it strange to hear my own voice, which of course makes the whole thing even more absurd.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🔑 I really need to reconsider my password strategy. 1Password and Apple&rsquo;s Keychain just don&rsquo;t cooperate well anymore on my systems, especially when Passkeys are involved. Autofill with 1Password is frequently broken, and you can&rsquo;t have both enabled. Perhaps I should designate my 1Password vault as the master (or as a backup?)  and save duplicates in Keychain to use for autofill. I&rsquo;m really unsure. I feels strange to have all my passwords in two separate &ldquo;clouds&rdquo;.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>📺 Even though the subscription price is personally a little too high for me, because I&rsquo;m actually trying to reduce subscription costs, I signed up for the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/play-save-videos-watch-later/id1596506190\">Play</a> 2.0 trial. I really like the new channel features and together with <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/vinegar-tube-cleaner/id1591303229\">Vinegar</a>, it helps me get over paying 24 € a month for a Youtube Prime Family subscription, which is actually way too expensive for my taste.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>📺 I&rsquo;m really looking forward to <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5875444/episodes/?season=3\">Slow Horses Season 3</a>, but before that, I want to finish <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14452776/\">The Bear</a> with my wife. Then there&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9140554/episodes/?season=2&amp;ref_=tt_eps_sn_2\">Loki S2</a> and the new season of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7772588/episodes/?season=4&amp;ref_=tt_eps_sn_4\">For All Mankind S4</a> waiting. Advent will definitely not be boring.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>Micro.blog is a service for which I have a kind of love-hate relationship (although this is greatly exaggerated). I want to love the service, and Manton seems to be a really nice person; the community and idea are also great.

It&rsquo;s supposed to be a simple service but often it ends up being totally complicated and confusing.

Let's see how much longer.\n\n- 🤷‍♂️ Somehow I can't decide right now whether I should publish my weeknotes in full length on [weblog.lol](https://blog.esamecar.net) or [micro.blog](https://mb.esamecar.net). So far, I have done it on weblog.lol and only created the shorter posts on micro.blog[^3]. But there are so many nice tools like [Micro Publish](https://github.com/otaviocc/obsidian-microblog), [MarsEdit](https://redsweater.com/marsedit/), and [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) to publish directly on mb. I'll just put the post on both platforms for now and think about how I will handle this in the future by next week.\n\n- ✏️ Speaking of [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), a really great editor that I use far too [infrequently](https://social.lol/@esamecar/111506814371408216), was just released in [Version 7](https://ia.net/topics/ia-writer-7). It has a very interesting approach regarding \"citing\"[^1] in Markdown files[^2]. There is also a [call](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/support-markdown-annotations-a-la-ia-writer-7/) to implement the syntax extension in Obsidian.\n\n- 🎙 And speaking of omg.lol. The [last episode](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/099) of [Hemispheric Views](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com) was not as absurdly funny as the [App Defaults](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097) episode, but [Adam](https://social.lol/@adam) was a guest. I always find it very interesting to hear what he has to say and am looking forward to his [25 days of omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol/advent).\n\n- 🖥️ This week at [Indie App Santa](https://indieappsanta.com), <a href=\"https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper\">MacWhisper</a>, probably the best-known Whisper client, was available for free. With [Hello Transcribe](https://www.bjnortier.com/2023/11/17/Hello-Transcribe-3.2.html), there seems to be an alternative that I have not yet tried myself.\n\n- 🖥️ Also using LLM, but not for transcription, rather for translation, is [Easydict](https://github.com/tisfeng/Easydict): *Easydict is a concise and easy-to-use translation dictionary macOS App that allows you to easily and elegantly look up words or translate text.* It supports a bunch of different services.\n\n- 👨‍💻 I started evaluating [MediaMate](https://wouter01.github.io/MediaMate/): *Fresh visuals for Volume, Brightness, and Now Playing*. It has a nice Notch UI for now playing. Have not tested how it plays together with [Notchmeister](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/notchmeister/id1599169747?mt=12), though.\n\n- 🕹 Started playing [Stray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stray_%28video_game%29). It is a welcome, quite peaceful change after the 100+ hours fighting as [Aloy](https://www.playstation.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west/).\n\n- 🕹 This week, I actually finished my first Mario game: [Super Mario Bros. Deluxe](https://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_Bros._Deluxe) (GBC). I played the cartridge on my [Analogue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co/pocket) and thanks to Save States, I have finally managed to see the end credit scene. With every other Mario, I gave up along the way at some point, even though I probably started them all.\n\n- 🕹 There are not only seemingly 23,342 different retro handhelds, but at least 42 new ones are added every week. I had not heard of the [Evercade EXP](https://evercade.co.uk/exp/) until now. You cannot play copies of your own ROMs or original cartridges here, but classics are reissued as cartridges for this system. Interesting concept, and there's even [Duke Nukem](https://evercade.co.uk/cartridges/duke-nukem-collection-1/)!\n\n- 👰 I found it interesting to read how much [fuss](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/01/fake-iphone-computational-photography-glitch) was made about this one [bride photo](https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/11/30/a-bride-to-be-discovers-a-reality-bending-mistake-in-apples-computational-photography). But probably because we no longer know or can assess what is real at all. I always wonder how my children are supposed to learn which statements in the form of a photo, a video, or an audio recording they can still trust. But that might also be the reason why many people only dive into their own filter bubble and generally dismiss everything as fake news that is too complicated for them or contradicts their own ideas and blindly believe what they want to believe. This is probably actually the biggest challenge we as a society are facing right now, alongside the climate crisis of course.\n\n- 👱 Speaking of audio recordings, I couldn't resist having my iPhone create [my own voice](https://support.apple.com/en-us/104993). I dutifully read aloud 150 sentences in English. At the beginning, I thought it would never end, but it went quickly towards the end. My iPhone then calculated a lot overnight and the next day I was allowed to try it out. The voice definitely sounds like me. But for my taste, it is significantly too slow. I don't know if this is generally the case or because I tried to speak as clearly as possible in a foreign language. How do people find it whose mother tongue is English? (I generally find it strange to hear my own voice, which of course makes the whole thing even more absurd.)\n\n- 🔑 I really need to reconsider my password strategy. 1Password and Apple's Keychain just don't cooperate well anymore on my systems, especially when Passkeys are involved. Autofill with 1Password is frequently broken, and you can't have both enabled. Perhaps I should designate my 1Password vault as the master (or as a backup?)  and save duplicates in Keychain to use for autofill. I'm really unsure. I feels strange to have all my passwords in two separate \"clouds\".\n\n- 📺 Even though the subscription price is personally a little too high for me, because I'm actually trying to reduce subscription costs, I signed up for the [Play](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/play-save-videos-watch-later/id1596506190) 2.0 trial. I really like the new channel features and together with [Vinegar](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/vinegar-tube-cleaner/id1591303229), it helps me get over paying 24 € a month for a Youtube Prime Family subscription, which is actually way too expensive for my taste.\n\n- 📺 I'm really looking forward to [Slow Horses Season 3](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5875444/episodes/?season=3), but before that, I want to finish [The Bear](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14452776/) with my wife. Then there's [Loki S2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9140554/episodes/?season=2&ref_=tt_eps_sn_2) and the new season of [For All Mankind S4](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7772588/episodes/?season=4&ref_=tt_eps_sn_4) waiting. Advent will definitely not be boring.\n\n[^1]: They call it \"text from AI tools\", but it's more ore less citation in the end.\n[^2]: I really do like their other Markdown based app <a href=\"https://ia.net/presenter\">iA Presenter</a>. There are a couple of similar apps already, like <a href=\"https://www.deckset.com\">Deckset</a> and <a href=\"https://hyperdeck.io/\">Hyperdeck</a>, but iA's implementation is awesome as usual.\n[^3]: Micro.blog is a service for which I have a kind of love-hate relationship (although this is greatly exaggerated). I want to love the service, and Manton seems to be a really nice person; the community and idea are also great. However, I always feel like mb is so fragile that you only have to look at it sideways for it to fall apart. Something is always not working and it seems very oddly cobbled together. It's supposed to be a simple service but often it ends up being totally complicated and confusing. I never know if I'm just too stupid to tick the right boxes, or if I've stumbled upon another bug again.\n",

So, here comes week 47.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>🎮 I finished playing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_Forbidden_West\">Horizon Forbidden West</a>. It was my first computer game in years, and probably the first AAA title in decades that I actually watched the end credits for. Usually, I start playing and then eventually stop. (Why should it be any different with video games than with other areas of my life?) I invested over 100 hours into Forbidden West, and whether or not that was a waste of time is for each person to decide, but I had a lot of fun. Over the past two weeks, I used the <a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/playstation-portal-remote-player/\">Playstation Portal</a>. This accessory for the PS5 is essentially just a (pretty good, but unfortunately not OLED) screen with a built-in, very good controller - nothing more and nothing less. It allows me to play on the couch in the living room while my wife watches one of her shows. (My wife doesn&rsquo;t like me playing games on the TV in the living room when she&rsquo;s present.) <a href=\"https://birchtree.me/blog/playstation-portal-early-review/\">The Portal suffers</a> from the same weaknesses as Playstation&rsquo;s Remote Play itself: even with very good Wi-Fi coverage and the PS5 connected to the router with a cable (and <a href=\"https://heydingus.net/blog/2023/11/playstation-ethernet-connection\">properly configured</a>), there are regular artifacts, slow downs, and sometimes even stuttering. I really hope that Sony gives its Remote Play implementation a little bit more attention and love now that they sell a dedicated device for this feature. But ultimately, I&rsquo;m quite satisfied, and the hardware is really well-made. (The lack of Bluetooth support doesn&rsquo;t bother me at all; I wouldn&rsquo;t want to constantly pair BT headphones anyway, and I actually have some very good headphones with a headphone jack that are happy to have found a new use.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>👾 Recently, my <a href=\"https://powkiddy.com/products/pre-sale-powkiddy-rgb30-rk3566-handheld-game-console-built-in-wifi\">Powkiddy RGB30</a> also arrived. The handheld device was highly praised by a bunch of youtubers  and the 1:1 screen is really great for GB, GBA, and GBC games. I also really like <a href=\"https://github.com/JustEnoughLinuxOS/distribution/releases\">JELOS</a>. HOWEVER, the hardware quality and customer service of this device and this company are extremely poor. The device arrived defective, with a stuck shoulder button. I had to contact Powkiddy multiple times to get a response. They casually suggested that I could try opening it up. Opening up a device that is only a few days old, still under warranty, with a spatula and screwdriver is not exactly what I had in mind. I actually managed to open the case and free the button without causing major damage to the device. Shortly after, another shoulder button got stuck, and then the first one again. And if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, the card slot eject mechanism also broke. All within one week. I really don&rsquo;t feel like having to dismantle the device every two days just to play a game for a few minutes. Powkiddy mentioned that I could send the device back to China at my own expense and then get a refund - yeah, right. Never ever again! 😡</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>👾 Speaking of retro gaming, while setting up the RGB30, I stumbled upon the <a href=\"https://lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php\">pico-8</a> Fantasy Console and was immediately impressed. I wasn&rsquo;t aware of the extent of this community. There are so many nice games, and almost all of them are free. You can play them on macOS, a variety of other operating systems, and even on retro handhelds. And as if that weren&rsquo;t enough, there&rsquo;s also the <a href=\"https://tic80.com\">TIC-80</a>. Oh boy!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🖥️ During the Black Week, or whatever this discount rally is called, I made my way through the impressive list of over 400 apps for macOS and iOS in the <a href=\"https://app.indieappsales.com\">Indie App Sales</a> 2023. Fortunately, I already own the ones that interest me most and &ldquo;only&rdquo; bought three additional small apps this year:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spin-the-wheel-pick-me/id1523238520\">Spin the Wheel - Pick Me</a> (iPadOS)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://candies-jam-92d.craft.me/MSXtqHo7c0lP3E\">NowPlaying - Liner Notes</a> (iOS)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1515445551?pt=121118333&amp;ct=IndieAppSales&amp;mt=8\">Pi-hole Remote</a> (macOS, iOS, iPadOS)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Nevertheless, it’s an impressive list that also includes many Mastodon developer accounts that I didn’t know about before. Definitely worth looking into.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🖥️ I also noticed <a href=\"https://unclutterapp.com/bundle/?coupon=DFX-BLACKFRIDAY-2023\">the Apps</a> campaign: 10 applications for you and your Mac. It really only lists great apps. And even though I use <a href=\"https://manytricks.com/moom/\">Moom</a>, I&rsquo;ve bought a single Mac license of <a href=\"https://thelasso.app\">Lasso</a> and both play quite nicely together.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>⌨️  <a href=\"https://obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html\">Launchbar</a>, the launcher I&rsquo;ve been using on macOS for almost 10 years, recently had noticeable delays when launching. It was impressive how my muscle memory was trained to expect to be able to perform actions immediately after pressing cmd+space. It was so bad, I took a look at <a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com\">Alfred</a> and <a href=\"https://www.raycast.com\">Raycast</a> again, but thanks to the nightly build Version 6.18.5 nightly (6247), everything is back to how I&rsquo;m used to it 😅</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>😍 Oh, and definitely not to be left unmentioned is this insanely awesome <a href=\"https://defaults.rknight.me/\">App Defaults movement</a> that <a href=\"https://social.lol/@robb\">Robb</a> unintentionally kicked off and wonderfully shows off.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>👖 Furthermore, I enjoyed &ldquo;the <a href=\"https://mstdn.social/@yurnidiot/111451042954144680\">walkthrough</a> explaining the inner workings of the ship that made the kessel run in less than 12 parsecs&rdquo;, saved <a href=\"https://asciiflow.com/#/\">ASCIIFlow</a> in my bookmarks, and <a href=\"https://social.lol/@muhh/111465755801912892\">pants</a> whose pockets may not be worn out by the phone after a few months.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

Powkiddy mentioned that I could send the device back to China at my own expense and then get a refund - yeah, right. Never ever again! 😡\n\n- 👾 Speaking of retro gaming, while setting up the RGB30, I stumbled upon the [pico-8](https://lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) Fantasy Console and was immediately impressed. I wasn't aware of the extent of this community. There are so many nice games, and almost all of them are free. You can play them on macOS, a variety of other operating systems, and even on retro handhelds. And as if that weren't enough, there's also the [TIC-80](https://tic80.com). Oh boy!\n\n- 🖥️ During the Black Week, or whatever this discount rally is called, I made my way through the impressive list of over 400 apps for macOS and iOS in the [Indie App Sales](https://app.indieappsales.com) 2023. Fortunately, I already own the ones that interest me most and \"only\" bought three additional small apps this year:\n\n\t- [Spin the Wheel - Pick Me](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spin-the-wheel-pick-me/id1523238520) (iPadOS)\n\t- [NowPlaying - Liner Notes](https://candies-jam-92d.craft.me/MSXtqHo7c0lP3E) (iOS)\n\t- [Pi-hole Remote](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1515445551?pt=121118333&ct=IndieAppSales&mt=8) (macOS, iOS, iPadOS)\n\n- Nevertheless, it’s an impressive list that also includes many Mastodon developer accounts that I didn’t know about before. Definitely worth looking into.\n\n- 🖥️ I also noticed [the Apps](https://unclutterapp.com/bundle/?coupon=DFX-BLACKFRIDAY-2023) campaign: 10 applications for you and your Mac. It really only lists great apps. And even though I use [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/), I've bought a single Mac license of [Lasso](https://thelasso.app) and both play quite nicely together.\n\n- ⌨️  [Launchbar](https://obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html), the launcher I've been using on macOS for almost 10 years, recently had noticeable delays when launching. It was impressive how my muscle memory was trained to expect to be able to perform actions immediately after pressing cmd+space. It was so bad, I took a look at [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) and [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) again, but thanks to the nightly build Version 6.18.5 nightly (6247), everything is back to how I'm used to it 😅\n\n- 😍 Oh, and definitely not to be left unmentioned is this insanely awesome [App Defaults movement](https://defaults.rknight.me/) that [Robb](https://social.lol/@robb) unintentionally kicked off and wonderfully shows off.\n\n- 👖 Furthermore, I enjoyed \"the [walkthrough](https://mstdn.social/@yurnidiot/111451042954144680) explaining the inner workings of the ship that made the kessel run in less than 12 parsecs\", saved [ASCIIFlow](https://asciiflow.com/#/) in my bookmarks, and [pants](https://social.lol/@muhh/111465755801912892) whose pockets may not be worn out by the phone after a few months.\n",

It was a rather intimate podcast. And both the developers of the <a href=\"https://darknoise.app\">Darknoise</a> app and <a href=\"https://sofahq.com\">Sofa</a> seem to be very nice people. After what they said about <strong>software subscriptions</strong>, I&rsquo;m afraid that sooner or later all apps will have to switch to the subscription model. I personally don&rsquo;t like that, but if there&rsquo;s no other way for indie developers, you probably have to think about what you&rsquo;re willing to spend per year and then keep an eye on your subscriptions, e.g. with <a href=\"https://bobbyapp.co\">Bobby</a>, and limit them accordingly.</li>\n<li>🛋️ Speaking of <a href=\"https://sofahq.com\">Sofa</a>. I really like the app, but I think I&rsquo;ll try to stay away from software and services where it&rsquo;s not possible to get your data out again with open standards, an API or at least an RSS feed.</li>\n<li>🫰 Speaking of subscriptions, after all this <a href=\"https://mas.to/@dcrainmaker/109761992004211636\">back and forth</a>, I <strong>cancelled my Strava subscription</strong>.

It&rsquo;s still fun to see all these many ideas for Mastodon clients. There hasn&rsquo;t been so much dynamism in the scene for a long time. Even though <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ice-cubes-for-mastodon/id6444915884\">IceCube</a> gets a lot of praise, I keep coming back to <a href=\"https://tapbots.com/ivory/\">Ivory</a>, which was finally released in the App Store this week. You can only have missed it, though, if you&rsquo;ve been living under a rock. Even though I find the development speed of IceCube absolutely remarkable and the app is certainly one of the most impressive in terms of features, I am still bothered by the many small bugs and especially the bad scrolling performance. (I think SwiftUI might be the one to blame here.) Ivory, on the other hand, is really fast and performant. The great thing is that you can change at any time.</li>\n<li>🕹️ I&rsquo;ve played the two new <strong>playdate games</strong> that were released for me this week: <a href=\"https://play.date/games/flipper-lifter/\">Flipper Lifter</a> and <a href=\"https://play.date/games/echoic-memory/\">Echoic Memory</a>. I am really bad at audio and don&rsquo;t know if I enjoy Echoic Memory and I haven&rsquo;t found any access to Flipper Lifter yet. In general, with some playdate games, I sometimes feel like I don&rsquo;t really understand the mechanics of the game, and just do anything that will somehow get me to the goal. I sometimes wish the games would introduce you a little more and not leave you completely out in the cold.</li>\n<li>🕹️ In the end, everything was overshadowed by the fact that my <strong>playdate</strong> probably <strong>has</strong> a <strong>faulty battery</strong>.

I really like the app, but I think I'll try to stay away from software and services where it's not possible to get your data out again with open standards, an API or at least an RSS feed.</li>\n<li>🫰 Speaking of subscriptions, after all this <a href=\"https://mas.to/@dcrainmaker/109761992004211636\">back and forth</a>, I <strong>cancelled my Strava subscription</strong>. I'll see if I can enjoy cycling without all their pro features.</li>\n<li>🚴‍♂️ Speaking of (I know, I know ...) cycling, once again I have felt annoyed, no, <strong>threatened by SUV</strong> drivers. I really don't know where all this is going. Fittingly, the <a href=\"https://indieweb.social/@magalhini/109739198359436268\">post</a> about the size of cars.</li>\n<li>🐘 I had a look at <strong><a href=\"https://social.shadowfacts.net/objects/25db7fa3-31e5-46aa-a534-643de7617f8e\">Tusker</a></strong>, a new iOS Mastodon client. It's still fun to see all these many ideas for Mastodon clients. There hasn't been so much dynamism in the scene for a long time. Even though <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ice-cubes-for-mastodon/id6444915884\">IceCube</a> gets a lot of praise, I keep coming back to <a href=\"https://tapbots.com/ivory/\">Ivory</a>, which was finally released in the App Store this week. You can only have missed it, though, if you've been living under a rock. Even though I find the development speed of IceCube absolutely remarkable and the app is certainly one of the most impressive in terms of features, I am still bothered by the many small bugs and especially the bad scrolling performance. (I think SwiftUI might be the one to blame here.) Ivory, on the other hand, is really fast and performant. The great thing is that you can change at any time.</li>\n<li>🕹️ I've played the two new <strong>playdate games</strong> that were released for me this week: <a href=\"https://play.date/games/flipper-lifter/\">Flipper Lifter</a> and <a href=\"https://play.date/games/echoic-memory/\">Echoic Memory</a>. I am really bad at audio and don't know if I enjoy Echoic Memory and I haven't found any access to Flipper Lifter yet. In general, with some playdate games, I sometimes feel like I don't really understand the mechanics of the game, and just do anything that will somehow get me to the goal. I sometimes wish the games would introduce you a little more and not leave you completely out in the cold. </li>\n<li>🕹️ In the end, everything was overshadowed by the fact that my <strong>playdate</strong> probably <strong>has</strong> a <strong>faulty battery</strong>. I have, surprisingly unexpectedly, received an answer from <a href=\"https://social.panic.com/@cabel/109757052741921514\">Cabel</a>, but unfortunately not yet from support. They seem to be quite overwhelmed by support requests right now.</li>\n<li>📱 On <strong>iOS</strong>, I looked at <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1489443070\">Countdown to Anything!</a> but I think I'll stick with <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/countdowns-termine-verfolgen/id917514700\">Countdowns</a>. </li>\n<li>📱 This <a href=\"https://social.lol/@inkeduprunner/109744118273037005\">screenshot</a> of Jason's homescreen inspired me to tinker a little bit with <a href=\"https://social.lol/@inkeduprunner/109744118273037005\">Widgy</a>. I also bought <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/opener-open-links-in-apps/id989565871\">Opener</a>, don't know why 😇</li>\n<li>💻 On the <strong>Mac</strong>, I've been looking at the new <a href=\"https://thebrowser.company\">Arc</a> browser, which is kind of hyped right now. I really don't know why though. I have a bit of a suspicion that it might just be the invite system. To me, the browser seems extremely sluggish. My password management and Apple Pay don't work, which is probably not the browser's fault. It's too early to judge, but so far I always go back to Safari after a short time. </li>\n<li>💻 It came to my mind, that you can use Markdown links of <a href=\"https://mastodon.cloud/@cogsciapps/109758770719895321\">hooked</a> items together with <a href=\"https://sindresorhus.com/one-thing\">One Thing</a>, an App that I really enjoy. It gives you one click menu bar item to the one file you are just working on.</li>\n<li>💻 I had a look at <a href=\"https://hidock.app/\">HiDock, for Mac</a> and <a href=\"https://thelasso.app/\">Lasso - Window Manager for macOS</a>.</li>\n<li>💻 Thanks to <a href=\"https://social.lol/@mken/109750124058233654\">Matthew</a> I became aware of <a href=\"https://menubarx.app\">Menubar X</a> (<a href=\"https://setapp.com/de/apps/menubarx\">Setapp</a>). This works pretty well together with <a href=\"https://www.deepl.com/translator\">DeepL</a> / <a href=\"https://www.deepl.com/write\">DeepL Write</a> and <a href=\"https://elk.zone/\">elk.zone</a>.</li>\n<li>✅ I've moved all my todo item for work from <a href=\"https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/\">OmniFocus</a> to Apple's Reminders app. I want to see if I can separate them enough thanks to smart lists and tags. The only thing I miss so far is the ability to filter by focus modes, like it is possible with Calendars, etc. Only Apple knows why this is not possible yet, I guess.</li>\n<li>❤️ Thanks to <a href=\"https://social.lol/@faisal/109750741237166481\">Faisal Misle</a>, I now also know that you can publish to the omg.lol weblog via <a href=\"https://github.com/neatnik/weblog.lol\">github</a>. I have no idea about all these things, but thanks to the many great tutorials, even I managed to do it. Speaking of <a href=\"https://omg.lol\">omg.lol</a> and how clueless I am about all this internet stuff, I managed to change my <a href=\"https://esamecar.status.lol\">status.log</a> via the <a href=\"https://api.omg.lol/\">API</a>, again thanks to the awesome docs. I control this with a Shortcuts shortcut and can trigger it from my <a href=\"https://www.elgato.com/\">Stream Deck</a> and <a href=\"https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/\">Keyboard Maestro</a>.

A podcast I did not know about before. This was a very intimate conversation and I discovered so much of myself in what was told. Unfortunately, I can't even begin to speak with such reflection and eloquence. There's definitely a reason I'm not a podcaster, and an absolutely insignificant little fish otherwise. What I also found very interesting was [The Talk Show: ‘Slow-Moving Hurricane’, With Craig Hockenberry](https://overcast.fm/+B7ND0zcCY). I only knew Craig Hockenberry from [his posts and profile picture](https://mastodon.social/@chockenberry). I was very surprised to listen to such a level-headed, reflective person. It's always exciting what impressions you get about people just by reading about them or listening to them. The episode [Really Specific Stories: Jason Burk](https://overcast.fm/+6u81QBHHQ) fit in very well with this. I'm already looking forward to the others.\n    - 🎙️ Parallel to the release of the two new games [Lost Your Marbles](https://play.date/games/lost-your-marbles/) and [Pick Pack Pup](https://play.date/games/pickpackpup/) in Series 1 for [my playdate](https://esamecar.net/2023/01/07/playdate.html) I listened to the respective podcast episodes: [Playdate Podcast: Pick Pack Pup](https://overcast.fm/+5Ddo1eC7M) and [Playdate Podcast: Lost Your Marbles](https://overcast.fm/+5DdrMprw0). \n    - 🎙️ Additionally I've listened to [Upgrade: 441: Qi2: Qi Harder](https://overcast.fm/+Fcm_P4vGY), [AppStories: Read-Later Apps](https://overcast.fm/+I5CmMcSjU), [Upgrade: 442: Zombie Arms and Toaster Fridge](https://overcast.fm/+Fcm-buxIs), [Under the Radar: 260: Subscription School](https://overcast.fm/+FgnYjcuX0), and [Connected: 433: The Best Alarm is the Alarm](https://overcast.fm/+FXx6P7vZI).\n- For these posts, I was looking for a way to log the podcast episodes I was listening to, but couldn't find a way to look them up in [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/). So I wrote a Shortcuts script that logs the currently playing episode to a Drafts document after 30 seconds.\n- 🥘 Speaking of the Shortcuts app. I love [Mela](https://mela.recipes) and in my family we use [Pon](https://www.ponlist.de) for shopping lists. Unfortunately, there is no way to export shopping lists directly from Mela to Pon. And it is not possible to import the corresponding Reminders list into Pon. So I put together a little [shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/9c1fa9b21f574dfd81d65e8ae55e8305) that somehow does the job.\n- ❤️ I was playing around with my [omg/now](https://now.esamecar.net) page.\n- 💻 I bought [Photos Workbench](https://www.houdah.com/photosWorkbench/). I think I will mainly use it to compare and select pictures. I really miss a corresponding function in the Photos app. I have looked a lot for alternatives and had even subscribed to Lightroom in the meantime. But that's a complete overkill and I don't want to have any more software from that company. That's why I'm happy that an app has now been released that will hopefully take care of that.\n- 🕹️ Played [Pick Pack Pup (2022)](https://www.giantbomb.com/pick-pack-pup/3030-82889/) and the first ten levels of [Gravity Express](https://social.lol/@esamecar/109727415412705797). The former is fine but I did not fell in love so far. The latter ist very similar to [Rocket Bytes](https://possiblyaxolotl.itch.io/rocketbytes) but Gravity Express has checkpoints, tasks, fuel, etc. I seems not that hardcore as the other. I really like what I've seen so far.\n- 🗼Stumbled across [Lantern](https://lantern.rknight.me). \n- Bought [Homecoming for Mastodon](https://mstdn.plus/@lapcatsoftware/109718227833446585). I think this can easily be done via Shortcuts too but anyways ...\n- 📺 No TV, now movies this week 😢\n- 🧊Gave the [IceCubeApp](https://github.com/Dimillian/IceCubesApp) beta another try. Unlike many others, I'm not warming up to the app. It has too many little bugs that make it hard for me to use it regularly. But of course, the whole [App Store approval saga](https://social.lol/@esamecar/109717531311835254) was funny - or rather the opposite.\n- 🎙️[MacWhisper](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper/large): It's absolutely impressive what's now possible.\n- 💬 Too much [Mastodon](https://social.lol/@esamecar) but I really like it there. And [Gruber](https://mastodon.social/@gruber) even replied to me. He [disagreed](https://mastodon.social/@gruber/109723774597173088) and I didn't want to argue, but whatever!\n",

I have just discovered that none of my Apple iCloud email aliases are working. Now the question: why and since when? I'd rather not know how many emails I've missed because of this. 🤯 At least, I think, I've resolved the issue: Under <a href=\"http://icloud.com\">icloud.com</a> / Mail / Settings / Accounts I’ve disabled the Alias addresses, filled in Fullname and Label, renabled the Account alias and now it’s working again.\n\n\n## 2023-01-25\n### Apple Mail (macOS 13.1)\n\nOf course, it would be nice if Apple Mail would also show me my emails.\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://mb.esamecar.net/uploads/2023/7fe26434ec.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Apple Mail not showing the selected mail.\" title=\"CleanShot 2023-01-25 at 09.31.34.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"596\" height=\"212\" />\n\n### Home Screen (iOS 16.2)\n\nAh, not only does the lock screen not want to show widgets all the time, the (Files.app) widget on the home screen can also be empty.\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://mb.esamecar.net/uploads/2023/a81e9280f8.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot iOS home screen with blank Files.app widget\" title=\"IMG_8231.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"139\" height=\"300\" />\n\n### App Store (iOS 16.2)\n\nWhy not give us even more sorting options for subscriptions? Would be very easy to implement as they do nothing.\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://mb.esamecar.net/uploads/2023/de546b57a5.png\" alt=\"Screenshot iOS App Store - sorting option in subscriptions list not working\" title=\"IMG_8237.PNG\" border=\"0\" width=\"138\" height=\"300\" />\n\n\n## 2023-01-19\n### Lockscreen (iOS 16.2)\nThere might be missing something, isn't it? 🤔\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://mb.esamecar.net/uploads/2023/2331098ccd.png\" alt=\"iOS lockscreen with blank widgets\" title=\"IMG_8201.PNG\" border=\"0\" width=\"138\" height=\"300\" />\n\n### Calendar deletion bug (iOS 16.2)\nDeletion of an entry from the search entry does not clear the deleted item from the list.\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://mb.esamecar.net/uploads/2023/ee9e177751.gif\" alt=\"Calender deletion bug deleting entry\" title=\"2023-01-19 12.32.55.gif\" border=\"0\" width=\"138\" height=\"300\" />\n\n\n## 2023-01-18\n### App Store (iOS 16.2)\nGoing back from the detail screen of a subscription and swiping up or down does not scroll the subscriptions in the list but the modal view.\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://mb.esamecar.net/uploads/2023/9d0522d702.gif\" alt=\"Animated Gif showing a scroll bug in App Store subscriptions\" title=\"2023-01-18 10.21.42.gif\" border=\"0\" width=\"138\" height=\"300\" />\n\n### Springboard (iOS 16.2)\nNot able to go back to the springboard. Swiping upwards is refused.\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://mb.esamecar.net/uploads/2023/9f091bd22c.gif\" alt=\"Animated Gif showing swipe up to go back to homescreen not working\" title=\"2023-01-18 10.27.30.gif\" border=\"0\" width=\"138\" height=\"300\" />\n\n\n## 2023-01-17\n### Xcode CLI tools\nSo, I wanted to install an App via <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">brew</a>. It told me that I don't have Xcode CLI tools installed and asked me to do so. I already had but, yeah, anyhow, I did it via the given shell command ... A few minutes later macOS tells me that there a two updates available. \n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://mb.esamecar.net/uploads/2023/9df68b44a0.png\" alt=\"Screenshot Updates available - CLI Tools Xcode\" title=\"updates_cli_xcode.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"299\" height=\"69\" />\n\nWTF? Why two versions? And why an update anyways, I just downloaded them directly from Apple?\n\n### Shortcuts\nThe Apple Shortcuts App constantly gets out of sync between my MacBook and my iPhone. Thanks!\n\n\n### Reminders\nWhy does adding reminders via Siri work without any problems under iOS and exactly the same request via Siri under macOS leads to absolutely pointless queries and error messages (at least when set to GER)? WTF?\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Here is a short list of apps I use a lot under macOS privately (so not only work related) or I have recently discovered and think I&rsquo;ll stick with them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://bunchapp.co/docs/\">Bunch</a>: Bunch describes itself as <em>&ldquo;a macOS utility that uses plain text scripts called “Bunches” to automate context switching. It sits in your menu [&hellip;]. Bunches can open apps, specific files, web pages, and more. For the Power Users, It also allows advanced scripting, system commands, and integration via a URL handler&rdquo;</em>. It&rsquo;s free to download, developed by <a href=\"https://nojack.easydns.ca/@ttscoff\">Brett Terpstra</a>. I switched from <a href=\"https://www.apptorium.com/workspaces\">Workspaces</a> by <a href=\"https://www.apptorium.com\">Apptorium</a>, which has a much more sophisticated visual concept. I also like the app very much and is also available via <a href=\"https://setapp.com/\">Setapp</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://ergonis.com/typinator\">Typinator</a>: <em>&ldquo;Enter words, sentences, or even entire paragraphs by typing just a few characters. Save time for the really important things in life.&quot;</em> If I use a Mac without Typinator installed, I can hardly operate it. Therefore, it is one of the first programmes I add. (The second one is <a href=\"https://1password.com/\">1Password</a>, but if I would start from scratch I would try to use the new build in password manager of macOS / iOS.) Many use <a href=\"https://textexpander.com/\">Textexpander</a>, but I feel more comfortable without a subscription model.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.raycast.com\">Raycast</a>: <em>&ldquo;Raycast is a blazingly fast, totally extendable launcher. It lets you complete tasks, calculate, share common links, and much more.&quot;</em> Before I discovered Raycast, I&rsquo;ve used Launchbar for over 15 years. It was one of these apps I would have taken with me to an lonely island. Other apps like <a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com\">Alfred</a> did not stick with me. I still like <a href=\"https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html\">Launchbar</a> a lot but enjoy the I am currently enjoying the immense expandability and dynamic development of Raycast. Right now Raycast made even my beloved window manager <a href=\"https://manytricks.com/moom/\">Moom</a> obsolete.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.craft.do\">Craft</a>: <em>&ldquo;Create documents, make impact.&quot;</em> I really enjoyed using Craft for some time.

				"content_text": "Here is a short list of apps I use a lot under macOS privately (so not only work related) or I have recently discovered and think I'll stick with them.\n\n- [Bunch](https://bunchapp.co/docs/): Bunch describes itself as <em>\"a macOS utility that uses plain text scripts called “Bunches” to automate context switching. It sits in your menu [...]. Bunches can open apps, specific files, web pages, and more. For the Power Users, It also allows advanced scripting, system commands, and integration via a URL handler\"</em>. It's free to download, developed by [Brett Terpstra](https://nojack.easydns.ca/@ttscoff). I switched from [Workspaces](https://www.apptorium.com/workspaces) by [Apptorium](https://www.apptorium.com), which has a much more sophisticated visual concept. I also like the app very much and is also available via [Setapp](https://setapp.com/).\n\n- <a href=\"https://ergonis.com/typinator\">Typinator</a>: <em>\"Enter words, sentences, or even entire paragraphs by typing just a few characters. Save time for the really important things in life.\"</em> If I use a Mac without Typinator installed, I can hardly operate it. Therefore, it is one of the first programmes I add. (The second one is <a href=\"https://1password.com/\">1Password</a>, but if I would start from scratch I would try to use the new build in password manager of macOS / iOS.) Many use <a href=\"https://textexpander.com/\">Textexpander</a>, but I feel more comfortable without a subscription model.\n\n- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com): <em>\"Raycast is a blazingly fast, totally extendable launcher. It lets you complete tasks, calculate, share common links, and much more.\"</em> Before I discovered Raycast, I've used Launchbar for over 15 years. It was one of these apps I would have taken with me to an lonely island. Other apps like [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) did not stick with me. I still like [Launchbar](https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html) a lot but enjoy the I am currently enjoying the immense expandability and dynamic development of Raycast. Right now Raycast made even my beloved window manager [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/) obsolete.  \n\n- [Craft](https://www.craft.do): <em>\"Create documents, make impact.\"</em> I really enjoyed using Craft for some time. But actually I think, I should not use another note silo and try to achieve what I want with Apple Notes. Nevertheless, the app is very comprehensive, cross platform and easy to begin with. If you have a [Setapp](https://setapp.com/de/apps/craft) subscription, you should definitely check it out. (At this point, of course, <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a> and <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/\">Notion</a> must also be mentioned, but neither of which I use in a private context so far.)\n\n- [Anybox](https://anybox.app): <em>\"Manage bookmarks like a pro.

				"content_html": "<p>I was motivated by <a href=\"https://micro.blog/muhh\">muhh</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.byzero.de/2023/01/08/week-its-a.html\">blog entry</a> to write down what was on my mind in the first week of January. I&rsquo;m not sure yet if this will become something more regular, but I wanted to start putting something online more often anyway - more on that below.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve had the last two weeks off. The weather was bad, I had a cold 🤧 and therefore a lot of cycling wasn&rsquo;t an option either (at least that&rsquo;s what I told myself). So, I used the time to hang out at the computer a little more than usally. There was a lot of exciting things to discover there.\nSomehow Elon started this with the downfall of twitter, which he initiated. I had only been there reading for years anyway, and then after the takeover I decided to download my data, delete the clients on my end devices and no longer use the account.</p>\n<p>As an alternative, I was of course interested in Mastodon and clicked an account on the standard instance <a href=\"https://mastodon.social\">mastodon.social</a>. Thanks to tools like <a href=\"https://www.movetodon.org\">movetodon</a> and <a href=\"https://glitch.com/~fedifinder\">fedifinder</a> my timeline has also filled up pretty quickly, and I actually &ldquo;met&rdquo; pretty quickly some real people with whom you could exchange ideas in a friendly manner. All in all a very positive experience.</p>\n<p>One great thing about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse\">fediverse </a> is the extreme dynamics of the tools and clients that are currently being built around it.

				"content_text": "<h1>What I have done in the first week of 2023  (teaser: mastodon, omg.lol, playdate, ankermake)</h1>\n<p>I was motivated by <a href=\"https://micro.blog/muhh\">muhh</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.byzero.de/2023/01/08/week-its-a.html\">blog entry</a> to write down what was on my mind in the first week of January. I'm not sure yet if this will become something more regular, but I wanted to start putting something online more often anyway - more on that below.</p>\n<p>I've had the last two weeks off. The weather was bad, I had a cold 🤧 and therefore a lot of cycling wasn't an option either (at least that's what I told myself). So, I used the time to hang out at the computer a little more than usally. There was a lot of exciting things to discover there. \nSomehow Elon started this with the downfall of twitter, which he initiated. I had only been there reading for years anyway, and then after the takeover I decided to download my data, delete the clients on my end devices and no longer use the account.</p>\n<p>As an alternative, I was of course interested in Mastodon and clicked an account on the standard instance <a href=\"https://mastodon.social\">mastodon.social</a>. Thanks to tools like <a href=\"https://www.movetodon.org\">movetodon</a> and <a href=\"https://glitch.com/~fedifinder\">fedifinder</a> my timeline has also filled up pretty quickly, and I actually \"met\" pretty quickly some real people with whom you could exchange ideas in a friendly manner. All in all a very positive experience.</p>\n<p>One great thing about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse\">fediverse </a> is the extreme dynamics of the tools and clients that are currently being built around it. It feels like back in the early days of Twitter where, for example, a single programmer, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loren_Brichter\">Loren Brichter</a>, with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweetie\">Tweetie</a> could turn the whole twitter landscape upside down. (BTW he only has an <a href=\"https://mastodon.cloud/@loren\">inactive account</a> on Mastodon 😢) </p>\n<p>I tried countless clients over a few days. Among others (unsorted)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ice Cubes for Mastodon (<a href=\"https://testflight.apple.com/join/tqI3dK1u\">beta</a>) by <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@dimillian\">@dimillian</a> (<a href=\"@icecubesapp@mastodon.cloud\">@icecubesapp</a>),</li>\n<li>Mammoth: for Mastodon (<a href=\"https://testflight.apple.com/join/HyL7boSn\">beta</a>) by <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@JPEGuin\">@JPEGuin@mastodon.social</a>,</li>\n<li>Wolly for Mastodon (<a href=\"https://testflight.apple.com/join/2LVAJQTP\">beta</a>) by <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@mttvll\">Matteo</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mastoot/id1501485410\">Mastoot</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mastodon/id1571998974\">Mastodon</a> (official app),</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/toot/id1229021451\">Toot!</a> (on <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@tootapp\">Mastodon</a>),</li>\n<li>Komondor (beta) by <a href=\"https://chaos.social/@343max\">@343max@chaos.social</a>, and</li>\n<li>Ivory (beta; officially alpha ;-)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The official app is okay, but IMHO not great; toot! I liked the range of functions very much, but you also have to cope with the strange design somehow. Because I follow some accounts that post a lot, and since the timeline on Mastodon is not orchestrated by any algorithms, posts from other people are in danger of being lost. Thats why a good list function is very important to me personally. There, Mammoth also makes a very good impression, but in the end I was lucky and was able to test <a href=\"https://tapbots.social/@ivory\">Ivory</a> via Testflight. The app by <a href=\"https://tapbots.social/@paul\">Paul Haddad</a> and <a href=\"https://tapbots.social/@mark\">Mark Jardine</a> has an button design that is a bit too playful for my taste, but otherwise it is extremely stable and really great at everything it does. The recently added <a href=\"https://social.lol/@esamecar/109653526172609597\">list features</a> are awesome, as they allow certain accounts to be hidden from the home view. So, atm I stick to Ivory and am looking forward to even better builds.</p>\n<p>Then, sometime last week, I came across a <a href=\"https://social.lol/@otaviocc/109607448264194924\">post</a> from <a href=\"https://social.lol/@otaviocc\">@otaviocc@social.lol</a> on <a href=\"https://home.omg.lol\">omg.lol</a>. And then, coincidentally, I signed up for the service with thousands of other people (<a href=\"https://omglol.news/2023/01/07/wildest-36-hours-ever\">who must have read a post on Hacker News</a> and not otaviocc's post 😎). \nOn omg.lol you ultimately get a \"funny\" address on the web that contains a wide variety of small services. A single page website (to use as a <a href=\"https://esamecar.omg.lol\">business card</a>), a <a href=\"http://esamecar.status.lol\">statuslog</a>, an omg.lol-email address (forwarder), different DNS services, pastebin, PURL service, a <a href=\"http://esamecar.weblog.lol\">weblog</a> (beta), etc. And while I was at it anyways, I also have my <a href=\"https://social.lol/@esamecar\">Mastodon</a> account moved from mastodon.social to <a href=\"https://social.lol\">social.lol</a>. Luckily that went really smoothly. It was a lot of fun getting involved, configuring everything and thinking about what it's even good for 🤦‍♂️.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, I continued to work with the <a href=\"https://www.ankermake.com/eu-en\">AnkerMake M5</a>, which also arrived after a very long wait at the beginning of December. All in all I'm very happy with the 3D printer, but still don't really know what got into me back in early 2022 when I backed it on Kickstarter. But that is definitely going too far at this point and maybe I'll go into more detail elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Well, micro.blog is kind of a universe in itself too. In addition to choosing a <a href=\"https://social.lol/@muhh/109652832580041607\">theme</a>, there is of course the client question. I got some for iOS (the official <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1253201335\">app</a>, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1437753701\">Gluon for Micro.blog</a> and MacOS (<a href=\"https://redsweater.com/marsedit\">MarsEdit 5</a>, which I use via <a href=\"https://setapp.com\">Setapp</a>) looked at various editors (<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ia-writer/id775737172\">iA Writer</a>, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/drafts/id1236254471\">Drafts</a> and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/runestone-text-editor/id1548193893\">Runestone</a>. In addition, there are useful tools as <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696\">Mimi Uploader</a> (iOS) to upload images and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1592173492\">Epilogue for Micro.blog</a> to track books, but I'm just starting out here, there are just too many apps and I have to see which ones \"click\" for me.</p>\n<p>There are of course all sorts of little helpers for publishing interesting links and posts on Mastodon or blog entries. Among others <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/linky-for-twitter-and-mastodon/id438090426\">Linky</a> and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/re-toot/id1661697436\">Re: Toot</a> by <a href=\"https://social.lol/@simonbs@mastodon.social\">Simon B. Støvring</a> (who, by the way, is also responsible for Runestone) I would like to mention at this point.</p>\n<p>As if all that wasn't enough, at the beginning of last week, after a 1.5 year wait, I received my long-awaited <a href=\"https://play.date\">playdate</a> game console. (In the meantime I had actually already forgotten that I had even ordered it and I was all the happier that it suddenly arrived.) It's a lot of fun to deal with the little yellow box and I wanted to jot down some impressions I got. I rented a domain with Wordpress installed last year already and tried a few things with <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">micro.blog</a> but didn't really publish anything on either platform. This year I wanted to change that and thus started with a <a href=\"https://esamecar.de/2023/01/07/playdate.html\">post about the playdate</a>.</p>\n<p>All in all, it was an exciting time in terms of IT.

The games are often offered on <a href=\"https://itch.io/games/tag-playdate\">itch.io</a> and usually cost somewhere between $1 and $10.</p>\n<p>So far I’ve been into <a href=\"https://rngpartygames.itch.io/bloom\">Bloom</a>, „a real-time narrative-driven social sim about starting up a flower shop“ and <a href =\"https://possiblyaxolotl.itch.io/rocketbytes\">Rocket Bytes</a>, „a 1-bit precision rocket flying reverse platformer“. The former is just plain nice, the latter hard as hell. Other games I would like to check out are <a href=\"https://ronlent.itch.io/eyeland\">EYELAND</a>, <a href=\"https://gingerbeardman.itch.io /daily-driver\">Daily Driver (Tech Demo)</a> and <a href=\"https://frankbsadgames.itch.io/a-balanced-brew\">A Balanced Brew</a>. And if you have a dollar left over, you can also buy <a href=\"https://kamibox.itch.io/a-joke-thats-worth-099\">A Joke Thats Worth $0.99</a> for a smile.</p>\n<p>As if that weren’t enough, Panic has an app called <a href=\"https://play.date/mirror/\">Mirror</a> that allows games to be streamed and recorded directly to a monitor. <a href=\"https://help.play.date/games/mirror/#key-uses\">Accessibility</a> has also been considered. And then of course there’s the <a href=\"https://play.date/dev/\">development environment</a>, once in professional and as if that wasn’t enough, also a comprehensive <a href=\"https ://play.date/pulp/\">web editor</a>, with which you can develop really professional games in the browser.</p>\n<p>It was also a good thing that I have been the happy owner of an <a href=\"https://www.ankermake.com/eu-en\">AnkerMake M5</a> since December 2022, so I was able to get a suitable <a href=\"https://www.printables.com/de/model/226801-magnetic-cover-for-playdate/files\">Magnetic Cover</a>, because unfortunately I didn’t have the official <a href=\" https://shop.play.date\">ordered</a> and now the shipping would be more expensive than the case itself ;-(</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://www.racemat.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8156-1.jpeg\" alt=\"3d printed magnetic cover for playdate\" title=\"IMG_8156.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"150\" /></p>\n<p>I’m excited to see how the little yellow part will continue, I’m looking forward to regular game updates for the next eleven weeks and at the same time I’ll be listening to the official <a href=\"https://podcast.play.date/\">podcast</a>. Long story short: for me personally a really compelling overall package.</p>\n",
