However, for those who don&rsquo;t already have a <a href=\"https://setapp.com/apps/bartender\">Setapp</a> subscription or don&rsquo;t want to pay that much money for a &ldquo;simple&rdquo; utility app, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/ibar-menubar-icon-control-tool/id6443843900?mt=12\">‚ÄéiBar-Menubar icon control tool</a> might be worth a look. However, you have to more or less blindly trust the developers, as their website will probably remain incomprehensible to many people.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>üõë If it also bothers you that every App Store link in Safari directly opens the store instead of just calling up the overview page, maybe this will help: <a href=\"https://github.com/lapcat/StopTheMacAppStore\">StopTheMacAppStore</a> - <em>Mac app that stops Safari from automatically opening the App Store app</em>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>üñ•Ô∏è I used to have a version of <a href=\"https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/\">iStat Menus</a> (<a href=\"https://setapp.com/apps/istat-menus\">Setapp</a>) running on every Mac, but nowadays I do without. However, there is also a number of alternatives, for example, the freshly updated <a href=\"https://usage.pro/\">Usage</a>, which, for instance, also allows access to the status of the Mac from a mobile device, or the free <a href=\"https://github.com/exelban/stats\">Stats</a> - <em>macOS system monitor in your menu bar.</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>üìÅ In <a href=\"https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/03/03/what-caught-my.html\">week 9</a>, I mentioned <a href=\"https://github.com/neilsardesai/Manila\">Manila</a>, a free app that lets you change the color of a folder&rsquo;s icon. There seems to be a similar paid upfront app called <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/foldery/id815333099\">Foldery</a>, that might be easier to set up and is regularly updated; bookmarked for the case that Manila stops working someday. If just a color is not enough, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/folderizer/id6480047256?mt=12\">‚ÄéFolderizer</a> might be worth a try, too. So far, I was occasionally using the <a href=\"https://setapp.com/apps/image2icon\">Setapp</a> version of <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/image2icon-make-your-icons/id992115977?mt=12&amp;ls=1\">Image2icon</a> but might give the former a shot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>üéÆ I fell in love with <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/gamery-game-tracker/id1607763458\">‚ÄéGamery - Game Tracker</a> and switched to the app from <a href=\"https://gametrack.app\">GameTrack</a>. Actually, I was looking for an app that runs both on iOS and macOS, but I am not very satisfied with the macOS version of GameTrack. The developer of Gamery has mentioned that he plans to enable the iPadOS version on macOS and is working on a native macOS version, too. That all sounds very good.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>üóìÔ∏è Sindre Sorhus makes so many great apps, and many of his programs are free. To support him, I bought the Mac App Store version of <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/dato/id1470584107?mt=12\">Dato</a> even though it was available via <a href=\"https://setapp.com/apps/dato\">Setapp</a>, too. Anyways, if you&rsquo;re looking for a free alternative, <a href=\"https://www.mowglii.com/itsycal/\">Itsycal for Mac</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/pakerwreah/Calendr\">Calendrx</a> might be worth a try.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>üì∏ I briefly looked into the new app from Aptonic, the developers of <a href=\"https://aptonic.com\">Dropzone</a> (<a href=\"https://setapp.com/apps/dropzone\">Setapp</a>), called <a href=\"https://screensnap.ai/\">ScreenSnapAI</a> - <em>AI Powered Screenshot Manager</em>. But that&rsquo;s not for me. I will definitely stick with <a href=\"https://cleanshot.com\">CleanShot X</a> (<a href=\"https://setapp.com/apps/cleanshot\">Setapp</a>) for the time being. By the way, did you know that pressing space to switch to window capture from capture area mode also works with CleanShot X and not only with the built-in macOS tool?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>üåê The one and only master of the indie web, <a href=\"https://social.lol/@robb\">Robb</a>, released <a href=\"https://echofeed.app/\">EchoFeed</a>. You have most probably already heard of his service to pipe an RSS feed to open web endpoints, like Mastodon or Micro.blog, etc. Love it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>üì≤ Did you know that you can change the iOS wheel picker to a <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@sandropennisi/112268681870145361\">number pad</a> by just clicking on it? I did not!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>üåç <a href=\"https://digitalcourage.social/@mjaschen/112264822932312746\">Marcus reminded me</a> that it is a very good idea to support OpenStreetMap.

However, for those who don't already have a [Setapp](https://setapp.com/apps/bartender) subscription or don't want to pay that much money for a \"simple\" utility app, [‚ÄéiBar-Menubar icon control tool](https://apps.apple.com/app/ibar-menubar-icon-control-tool/id6443843900?mt=12) might be worth a look. However, you have to more or less blindly trust the developers, as their website will probably remain incomprehensible to many people.\n\n- üõë If it also bothers you that every App Store link in Safari directly opens the store instead of just calling up the overview page, maybe this will help: [StopTheMacAppStore](https://github.com/lapcat/StopTheMacAppStore) - *Mac app that stops Safari from automatically opening the App Store app*.\n\n- üñ•Ô∏è I used to have a version of [iStat Menus](https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/) ([Setapp](https://setapp.com/apps/istat-menus)) running on every Mac, but nowadays I do without. However, there is also a number of alternatives, for example, the freshly updated [Usage](https://usage.pro/), which, for instance, also allows access to the status of the Mac from a mobile device, or the free [Stats](https://github.com/exelban/stats) - *macOS system monitor in your menu bar.*\n\n- üìÅ In [week 9](https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/03/03/what-caught-my.html), I mentioned [Manila](https://github.com/neilsardesai/Manila), a free app that lets you change the color of a folder's icon. There seems to be a similar paid upfront app called [Foldery](https://apps.apple.com/app/foldery/id815333099), that might be easier to set up and is regularly updated; bookmarked for the case that Manila stops working someday. If just a color is not enough, [‚ÄéFolderizer](https://apps.apple.com/app/folderizer/id6480047256?mt=12) might be worth a try, too. So far, I was occasionally using the [Setapp](https://setapp.com/apps/image2icon) version of [Image2icon](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/image2icon-make-your-icons/id992115977?mt=12&ls=1) but might give the former a shot.\n \n- üéÆ I fell in love with [‚ÄéGamery - Game Tracker](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/gamery-game-tracker/id1607763458) and switched to the app from [GameTrack](https://gametrack.app). Actually, I was looking for an app that runs both on iOS and macOS, but I am not very satisfied with the macOS version of GameTrack. The developer of Gamery has mentioned that he plans to enable the iPadOS version on macOS and is working on a native macOS version, too. That all sounds very good.\n\n- üóìÔ∏è Sindre Sorhus makes so many great apps, and many of his programs are free. To support him, I bought the Mac App Store version of [Dato](https://apps.apple.com/app/dato/id1470584107?mt=12) even though it was available via [Setapp](https://setapp.com/apps/dato), too. Anyways, if you're looking for a free alternative, [Itsycal for Mac](https://www.mowglii.com/itsycal/) or [Calendrx](https://github.com/pakerwreah/Calendr) might be worth a try.\n\n- üì∏ I briefly looked into the new app from Aptonic, the developers of [Dropzone](https://aptonic.com) ([Setapp](https://setapp.com/apps/dropzone)), called [ScreenSnapAI](https://screensnap.ai/) - *AI Powered Screenshot Manager*. But that's not for me. I will definitely stick with [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com) ([Setapp](https://setapp.com/apps/cleanshot)) for the time being. By the way, did you know that pressing space to switch to window capture from capture area mode also works with CleanShot X and not only with the built-in macOS tool?\n\n- üåê The one and only master of the indie web, [Robb](https://social.lol/@robb), released [EchoFeed](https://echofeed.app/). You have most probably already heard of his service to pipe an RSS feed to open web endpoints, like Mastodon or Micro.blog, etc. Love it.\n\n- üì≤ Did you know that you can change the iOS wheel picker to a [number pad](https://mastodon.social/@sandropennisi/112268681870145361) by just clicking on it? I did not!\n\n- üåç [Marcus reminded me](https://digitalcourage.social/@mjaschen/112264822932312746) that it is a very good idea to support OpenStreetMap. I am now an associated member.\n\n- üì∫ Watched the Pilot of [Palm Royale](https://trakt.tv/shows/palm-royale/seasons/1/episodes/1) with my wife. Not yet sure what it will turn into.\n",

Especially for the younger ones, who let it show more, the fact that there was almost no functioning internet in the area and in the vacation apartment was quite noticeable. Wi-Fi and mobile networks were unusable. It took several minutes just to retrieve a single email. Social media, game streaming, YouTube, etc. were completely unthinkable.

I've been using the basic concept [^2] of the [Johnny.Decimal System](https://johnnydecimal.com/00-09-site-administration/00-index/) for many years (I would claim ten, but I don't know how long it's been around actually), but especially in a work context I eventually hit my limits with the system and am curious if I can apply it even better if I engage with it more intensively.\n\n- üéÆ I spent way too much time with [Batocara.linux](https://batocera.org) this week. I installed it on a Raspberry Pi and a [derivative](https://github.com/rg35xx-cfw/rg35xx-cfw.github.io/releases) of it on the [Anbernic RG35XX H](https://anbernic.com/products/rg35xx-h). Wow, I'm very impressed with what's possible with it. It looks so stunning ü•∞.\n\n- üì∫ Continued watching [For All Mankind S04](https://trakt.tv/shows/for-all-mankind/seasons/4).\n\n- üòä My mood was better than last week but not perfect. I hope yours is and have a nice week ahead!\n\n---\n**Update 2024-02-20**\n- Added reason why I don't yet use Link Cluster as my bookmark manager of choice.\n- Added disappointment about Reor.\n\n\n[^1]: Speaking of training, since the beginning of the year I've been doing workouts six to seven days a week (sometimes only for 15 min), of which I ride 5 - 6 times on the trainer (30 - 60 min). It's actually way too strenuous for me, but my FTP at the end of the week attested me a significant jump üéâ . Now I just need to muster the strength to lose 10 kg. But phew, one thing at a time.\n\n[^2]: Meanwhile, my file storage in Obsidian has also partially merged with the PARA system and is threatening to collapse into chaos.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Continuing from week <a href=\"https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/01/28/what-caught-my.html\">04</a>, here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the fifth week of 2024:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>üéÆ This week I had to repeatedly curb my nearly uncontrollable urge to buy gadgets I don&rsquo;t need - so far quite successfully. I did not order the <a href=\"https://www.ayaneo.com/product/AYANEO-NEXT-LITE.html\">Ayaneo Next LITE</a> nor pledged the <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ayaneo-flip-world-1st-dual-screen-windows-handheld--2#/\">Ayaneo Flip - World 1st Dual-Screen Windows Handheld</a> on Indiegogo. I definitely do not need more gaming handhelds at the moment, even though I don&rsquo;t own one that supports Windows games yet. My backlog is already long enough, I don&rsquo;t need another platform with even more games that I will never play. <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>üïπÔ∏è One of the games therein is <a href=\"https://exok.com/games/celeste/\">Celeste</a> for the Switch or Playstation. It <a href=\"https://retrododo.com/celeste-64/\">seems to be an absolute classic</a> and I only know the version for the <a href=\"https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=2145\">pico-8</a>, where it all started. It&rsquo;s really hard and so far I can&rsquo;t even get past the third (or fourth?) screen. Regardless, there is now a version as a homage to the N64 area: <a href=\"https://maddymakesgamesinc.itch.io/celeste64\">Celeste 64: Fragments of the Mountain by Maddy Makes Games, Heidy Motta, Noel, saint11</a>. Unfortunately not yet for the Mac, but in the comments you could already read that it is technically quite possible and probably will come.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>üñ•Ô∏è Speaking of gaming on the Mac: This week <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/death-stranding-directors-cut/id6449748961\">Death Stranding Director&rsquo;s Cut</a> was released. I hadn&rsquo;t dealt with the game so far, I don&rsquo;t know either the original version for the PS4 or the Director&rsquo;s Cut for the PS5. Unlike Resident Evil 4, which recently appeared for Apple&rsquo;s devices, this was an opportunity to get an AAA game for macOS at a reasonable price that I hadn&rsquo;t played before. And wow, I am absolutely impressed by the graphics on my MacBook Pro M2 so far. Holy shit, I mean, wow. So far I was not considering a Mac being able to do such a thing. Whether the actual game will appeal to me, I still have to find out, but as a tech demo it has definitely already picked me up. To be able to play it better, I bought a <a href=\"https://www.8bitdo.com/pro2/\">Pro 2 Controller</a> from 8BitDo. At first I despaired of their product portfolio, <sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> and then I realized that I could have used an old PS4 controller. Well, what can you do. I guess, now I am not only somehow collecting retro handhelds, but also game controllers &hellip;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>‚è±Ô∏è The release of Death Stranding was well timed, as I finished the story of Diablo IV after about 56 hours of playtime this week. I can note for myself that I always take about twice as long for a game as indicated on <a href=\"https://howlongtobeat.com/game/71960\">HowLongToBeat</a> ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. My Rogue is now level 49 and I will definitely tackle the end game again, at least until I reach level 50 with her. I enjoyed the game, but Diablo IV did not 100% convince me. At first it overwhelmed me with its complexity and its own language for all the facets of the game. The whole system seems unnecessarily complicated to me and later the gameplay became quiet repetitive. And all this in-game loot box up sell shit really got on my nerves. I mean, you buy a full price game and then you&rsquo;re constantly being thrown  pointless IAPs for up to 150 ‚Ç¨ in your face. Seriously?! Anyway, in the next few weeks I think I will focus again on Super Marios Bros. 3 (GBA) on my <a href=\"https://www.analogue.co\">Analogue</a> Pocket and look maybe at smaller indie titles on the console at most. Then I see if I enjoy Death Stranding. Maybe I&rsquo;ll understand the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QLq2k22AB0\">trailer for part 2</a> better afterwards?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>üéÆ BTW what definitely interests me more than a Windows handheld is the now possibly upcoming Switch 2 this year and I found the rumors that <a href=\"https://retrododo.com/ps-vitas-successor-is-reportedly-on-the-way/\">The PS Vita&rsquo;s Successor Is Reportedly On The Way &amp; Compatible With PS4/PS5 Titles</a> interesting, too.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>üì± I also did not give in to my impulse to pre-order a rabbit <a href=\"https://www.rabbit.tech/\">r1 - your pocket companion</a>. I find the r1 very exciting as a concept study. I like the design, which comes from the <a href=\"https://teenage.engineering\">same pen</a> as the <a href=\"https://play.date\">playdate</a>. However, the r1 would not be delivered to Europe until the second half of the year anyways, and if the rumors are true, hopefully a usable AI will also be included in <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/01/tim-cook-apple-ai-ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> in the fall. Ultimately, of course, something like this belongs in the smartphone, and I therefore see the r1 at best as a cute gimmick, without a real future. But that&rsquo;s not a reason not to have fun with a toy, is it?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>üíª If I understood correctly, the r1 uses <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai\">perplexity.ai</a>, about which I have read a lot of good things lately. Therefore, I wanted to take a closer look at this service, but their Cloudflare configuration initially did not want to <a href=\"https://social.lol/@esamecar/111861940258698097\">let me play along</a> with Safari ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I don&rsquo;t know what exactly Cloudflare didn&rsquo;t like, the check also came with the Arc browser, but disappeared after some time. I&rsquo;m not really convinced yet, but I definitely need to use the service more to form a final opinion.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>üåê Speaking of <a href=\"https://arc.net\">Arc Browser</a>, I suspect that <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/arc-search/id6472513080\">‚ÄéArc Search</a> also uses <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai\">perplexity.ai</a>, especially since it can be configured as the default search engine in Arc. I am still not 100% convinced by the browser, either. It all seems a bit strange and opaque to me (why do I need an account to surf the web?!) <sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup> and I find the browser itself quite sluggish and already a  bit bloated. I also don&rsquo;t know what to make of this <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/news/the-browser-company-announces-act-ii-for-arc-the-browser-that-browses-for-you/\">Act II</a>. Anyway, there were very <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/arc-search-for-iphone/\">enthusiastic reports</a> about Arc Search, but the app hasn&rsquo;t really picked me up yet by now. I will force myself to use it more often in the next few days in order to be able to form a better opinion.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>üöÄ I stumbled upon this post in my RSS Reader - <a href=\"https://www.blast-o-rama.com/2024/01/30/the-iconfactory-looks-to-launch-project-tapestry-via-kickstarter/\">The Iconfactory Looks To Launch PROJECT TAPESTRY via Kickstarter</a> - and more or less backed the <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iconfactory/project-tapestry\">Early Bird Special</a> immediately: <em>With Project Tapestry, we&rsquo;ll create a universal, chronological timeline for iOS for any data that‚Äôs publicly available on the Internet.</em> Who doesn&rsquo;t like the guys from <a href=\"https://iconfactory.com\">The Iconfactory</a> and after the whole Twitter debacle a year ago, I&rsquo;m happy to support the developers. I&rsquo;m curious to see if an app will ultimately come out that I find useful, and if not, at least I was able to follow the development and had access to some nice <a href=\"https://wallaroo.app\">wallpapers</a> for a year ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Not coincidentally, <a href=\"https://gloria.social/@rizzi/111856959119832404\">Silvio Rizzi</a> announced his new app a few days later: <em>A new app, completely rebuilt and rethought from the ground up.

I think I just have to spend February without consuming alcohol as well and prepare better for March ü§£ On my list of ideas is also &ldquo;A month without a smartphone&rdquo; or &ldquo;A month without an Apple Watch&rdquo;. That seems too crazy to me right now, and maybe I&rsquo;ll combine it into a &ldquo;A month less gadgets&rdquo; and give up my iPhone or my watch for &ldquo;only&rdquo; a week each, like Arne did with his <a href=\"https://arne.me/articles/i-lived-7-days-without-a-smartphone\">phone</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>üòÇ When I read this, I had to laugh a lot:<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup> <a href=\"https://www.heise.de/news/Deutsche-Bahn-sucht-Admin-fuer-Windows-3-11-for-Workgroups-9611543.html\">Deutsche Bahn sucht Admin f√ºr Windows 3.11 for Workgroups</a>, which means &ldquo;Deutsche Bahn is looking for an Admin for Windows 3.11 for Workgroups&rdquo; and immediately thought of <a href=\"https://norden.social/@racemase/111341692772365841\">my photo</a> which I took in one of our, oh so modern, ICE trains last November.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>üìö I stumbled upon this at <a href=\"https://heydingus.net/blog/2024/1/7-things-this-week-129\">Hey Dingus</a>: <a href=\"https://www.perry.qa/morse\">Learn Morse Code</a>.

				"content_text": "\nContinuing from week [04](https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/01/28/what-caught-my.html), here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the fifth week of 2024:\n\n- üéÆ This week I had to repeatedly curb my nearly uncontrollable urge to buy gadgets I don't need - so far quite successfully. I did not order the [Ayaneo Next LITE](https://www.ayaneo.com/product/AYANEO-NEXT-LITE.html) nor pledged the [Ayaneo Flip - World 1st Dual-Screen Windows Handheld](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ayaneo-flip-world-1st-dual-screen-windows-handheld--2#/) on Indiegogo. I definitely do not need more gaming handhelds at the moment, even though I don't own one that supports Windows games yet. My backlog is already long enough, I don't need another platform with even more games that I will never play. [^1]\n\n- üïπÔ∏è One of the games therein is [Celeste](https://exok.com/games/celeste/) for the Switch or Playstation. It [seems to be an absolute classic](https://retrododo.com/celeste-64/) and I only know the version for the [pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=2145), where it all started. It's really hard and so far I can't even get past the third (or fourth?) screen. Regardless, there is now a version as a homage to the N64 area: [Celeste 64: Fragments of the Mountain by Maddy Makes Games, Heidy Motta, Noel, saint11](https://maddymakesgamesinc.itch.io/celeste64). Unfortunately not yet for the Mac, but in the comments you could already read that it is technically quite possible and probably will come.\n\n- üñ•Ô∏è Speaking of gaming on the Mac: This week [Death Stranding Director's Cut](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/death-stranding-directors-cut/id6449748961) was released. I hadn't dealt with the game so far, I don't know either the original version for the PS4 or the Director's Cut for the PS5. Unlike Resident Evil 4, which recently appeared for Apple's devices, this was an opportunity to get an AAA game for macOS at a reasonable price that I hadn't played before. And wow, I am absolutely impressed by the graphics on my MacBook Pro M2 so far. Holy shit, I mean, wow. So far I was not considering a Mac being able to do such a thing. Whether the actual game will appeal to me, I still have to find out, but as a tech demo it has definitely already picked me up. To be able to play it better, I bought a [Pro 2 Controller](https://www.8bitdo.com/pro2/) from 8BitDo. At first I despaired of their product portfolio, [^5] and then I realized that I could have used an old PS4 controller. Well, what can you do. I guess, now I am not only somehow collecting retro handhelds, but also game controllers ...\n\n- ‚è±Ô∏è The release of Death Stranding was well timed, as I finished the story of Diablo IV after about 56 hours of playtime this week. I can note for myself that I always take about twice as long for a game as indicated on [HowLongToBeat](https://howlongtobeat.com/game/71960) ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. My Rogue is now level 49 and I will definitely tackle the end game again, at least until I reach level 50 with her. I enjoyed the game, but Diablo IV did not 100% convince me. At first it overwhelmed me with its complexity and its own language for all the facets of the game. The whole system seems unnecessarily complicated to me and later the gameplay became quiet repetitive. And all this in-game loot box up sell shit really got on my nerves. I mean, you buy a full price game and then you're constantly being thrown  pointless IAPs for up to 150 ‚Ç¨ in your face. Seriously?! Anyway, in the next few weeks I think I will focus again on Super Marios Bros. 3 (GBA) on my [Analogue](https://www.analogue.co) Pocket and look maybe at smaller indie titles on the console at most. Then I see if I enjoy Death Stranding. Maybe I'll understand the [trailer for part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QLq2k22AB0) better afterwards?\n\n- üéÆ BTW what definitely interests me more than a Windows handheld is the now possibly upcoming Switch 2 this year and I found the rumors that [The PS Vita's Successor Is Reportedly On The Way & Compatible With PS4/PS5 Titles](https://retrododo.com/ps-vitas-successor-is-reportedly-on-the-way/) interesting, too.\n\n- üì± I also did not give in to my impulse to pre-order a rabbit [r1 - your pocket companion](https://www.rabbit.tech/). I find the r1 very exciting as a concept study. I like the design, which comes from the [same pen](https://teenage.engineering) as the [playdate](https://play.date). However, the r1 would not be delivered to Europe until the second half of the year anyways, and if the rumors are true, hopefully a usable AI will also be included in [iOS 18](https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/01/tim-cook-apple-ai-ios-18/) in the fall. Ultimately, of course, something like this belongs in the smartphone, and I therefore see the r1 at best as a cute gimmick, without a real future. But that's not a reason not to have fun with a toy, is it?\n\n- üíª If I understood correctly, the r1 uses [perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai), about which I have read a lot of good things lately. Therefore, I wanted to take a closer look at this service, but their Cloudflare configuration initially did not want to [let me play along](https://social.lol/@esamecar/111861940258698097) with Safari ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I don't know what exactly Cloudflare didn't like, the check also came with the Arc browser, but disappeared after some time. I'm not really convinced yet, but I definitely need to use the service more to form a final opinion.\n\n- üåê Speaking of [Arc Browser](https://arc.net), I suspect that [‚ÄéArc Search](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/arc-search/id6472513080) also uses [perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai), especially since it can be configured as the default search engine in Arc. I am still not 100% convinced by the browser, either. It all seems a bit strange and opaque to me (why do I need an account to surf the web?!) [^2] and I find the browser itself quite sluggish and already a  bit bloated. I also don't know what to make of this [Act II](https://www.macstories.net/news/the-browser-company-announces-act-ii-for-arc-the-browser-that-browses-for-you/). Anyway, there were very [enthusiastic reports](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/arc-search-for-iphone/) about Arc Search, but the app hasn't really picked me up yet by now. I will force myself to use it more often in the next few days in order to be able to form a better opinion.\n\n- üöÄ I stumbled upon this post in my RSS Reader - [The Iconfactory Looks To Launch PROJECT TAPESTRY via Kickstarter](https://www.blast-o-rama.com/2024/01/30/the-iconfactory-looks-to-launch-project-tapestry-via-kickstarter/) - and more or less backed the [Early Bird Special](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iconfactory/project-tapestry) immediately: *With Project Tapestry, we'll create a universal, chronological timeline for iOS for any data that‚Äôs publicly available on the Internet.* Who doesn't like the guys from [The Iconfactory](https://iconfactory.com) and after the whole Twitter debacle a year ago, I'm happy to support the developers. I'm curious to see if an app will ultimately come out that I find useful, and if not, at least I was able to follow the development and had access to some nice [wallpapers](https://wallaroo.app) for a year ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Not coincidentally, [Silvio Rizzi](https://gloria.social/@rizzi/111856959119832404) announced his new app a few days later: *A new app, completely rebuilt and rethought from the ground up. This probably won‚Äôt replace the current Reeder (not going away) for a lot of users.* He also didn't miss the opportunity to show Project Tapestry directly in his screenshot üòà.\n\n- üßπ This little app from [Gui Rambo](https://mastodon.social/@_inside) *helps you clean your Mac's keyboard and trackpad*: [CleanupBuddy](https://cleanupbuddy.app/).\n\n- üìé As announced [last week](https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/01/28/what-caught-my.html), I took a look at [Link Cluster](https://www.witt-software.com/linkcluster/) - *Collect and manage links*. In principle, I like the app, but it yet lacks the ability to copy links as Markdown links, and that alone is a reason for me to stick with [Anybox](https://anybox.app/) for now. Therefore, I have not yet bought the full version and cannot assess how Link Cluster handles large bookmark collections. But I will definitely continue to follow the development of the app.\n\n- üé• I stumbled upon this at the beginning of the week on [Waxy.org](https://waxy.org) and am surprised that it is still online: [ASCII Theater](https://ascii.theater/) - *stream free-text-based movies-in your-terminal*.\n\n- I was very happy and honoured that [Michael](https://social.lol/@mihobu) included my little site in his [blogroll](https://mihobu.lol/blogroll). I also enjoy reading his posts a lot, so its mutual. I also need to revise my own [blogroll](https://mb.esamecar.net/blogroll/), I just have to find the time to do it.\n\n- üìµ At the beginning of the year, I had resolved to give up certain things for a few months, each for a month. In January, I started with giving up alcohol and today I realized that it is already February. My problem now is that all the things I had thought of not doing for February, I have already done in the last three days ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Now what?!

I would also like to learn something like this. But first, I should probably start refreshing the tying of various [knots](https://www.animatedknots.com/).\n\n- üç™ I printed a very large [Oreo cookie](https://www.printables.com/de/model/658952-giant-oreo-container). It weighs (not just a feeling) a good half kilogram, consists of six parts, has hardly any space inside but is absolutely awesome. In addition, I printed a [HomePod Mini stand](https://www.printables.com/de/model/56004-homepod-mini-stand) for ours in the kitchen. This way it might survive a disaster better. I also like this [Apple Watch Stand](https://www.printables.com/de/model/518689-apple-watch-stand) and while I was at it, I also printed [SNES Cartridge Holder (PAL)](https://www.printables.com/de/model/423218-snes-cartridge-holder-pal) and the [N64 Single Cartridge Display Stand](https://www.printables.com/de/model/512566-n64-single-cartridge-display-stand) for my Super Mario cartridges.\n\n- üñ®Ô∏è The next project for my [AnkerMake M5](https://www.ankermake.com/eu-en/m5?ref=naviMenu_2_2_img) is to take a closer look at [Gridfinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra_9zU-mnl8). It seems to me to be a [nice system](https://gridfinity.xyz). Now I just need to figure out which base plates I can best use.\n\n- üíª This week I wanted to use a VPN connection with a device that is only WLAN capable. Since there is no way to set up a VPN service directly on the device, I thought it should be easy to make my Mac's VPN connection available to other devices via WLAN Sharing. Well, far from it.

I therefore moved my private Obsidian vault to a European server and immediately imagine that the synchronization is faster. Apart from that, I find it better anyway to know my data in a European data center.\n\n- üì∫ Continued watching [For All Mankind](https://trakt.tv/shows/for-all-mankind/seasons/4) S4 with my wife. I enjoy this TV show but it definitely does not make you happy or confident.\n\n[^1]: Buying computer games is also a kind of [addiction for me](https://social.lol/@esamecar/111846076008240616).\n[^2]: Is that still the case? ü§î\n[^3]: Actually, it's much too sad, but by now I have come to terms with the fact that I live in a country where a lot, a lot is broken and only a few people believe we are at the forefront of anything or really good at it.\n[^4]: But I was allowed to buy a projector and a portable screen for shared movie nights.\n[^5]: I find it very confusing and difficult to find out which controller fits with which device how.

Whether Apple has chosen an appropriate strategy, I don&rsquo;t know either, see also <a href=\"https://thedent.net/post/apple-ruins-its-big-week-9nanx5jv\">Apple ruins its big week</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>üéÆ My <a href=\"https://anbernic.com/products/rg35xx-h\">Anbernic RG35XX H</a> arrived. Now I can sell my RG353PS and send the RGB30 (more or less electronic waste right from the start) to recycling. So far, one is more or less reliant on the stock firmware, which isn&rsquo;t very nice. But there are a number of very young <a href=\"https://retrohandheldguides.com/rg35xx-h-custom-firmware/\">Custom Firmware Projects</a> and also a <a href=\"https://github.com/cbepx-me/RG35xx-P-RG35xx-H-Modification\">cleaned-up stock version</a>. To not lose track of all the associated SD cards, I printed a series of these <a href=\"https://www.printables.com/de/model/27021-micro-sd-label-sticks\">Micro-SD Label Sticks</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>üïπÔ∏è I was surprised to learn how easy it is to get <a href=\"https://youtu.be/KURrNV7jupI?si=brG7PHl53uC_GAQB\">The Full AMIGA Experience on Analogue Pocket</a>.

Only sometimes I wish that the sync speed would be much faster.

				"content_text": "\nContinuing from week [03](https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/01/22/what-caught-my.html), here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the fourth week of 2024:\n\n- üåê I didn't quite understand the commotion about the DMA this week. [Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/apples_plans_for_the_dma) proved himself to be a true patriot once again, and I still don't understand where exactly the doomsday mood is coming from. Whether Apple has chosen an appropriate strategy, I don't know either, see also [Apple ruins its big week](https://thedent.net/post/apple-ruins-its-big-week-9nanx5jv).\n\n- üéÆ My [Anbernic RG35XX H](https://anbernic.com/products/rg35xx-h) arrived. Now I can sell my RG353PS and send the RGB30 (more or less electronic waste right from the start) to recycling. So far, one is more or less reliant on the stock firmware, which isn't very nice. But there are a number of very young [Custom Firmware Projects](https://retrohandheldguides.com/rg35xx-h-custom-firmware/) and also a [cleaned-up stock version](https://github.com/cbepx-me/RG35xx-P-RG35xx-H-Modification). To not lose track of all the associated SD cards, I printed a series of these [Micro-SD Label Sticks](https://www.printables.com/de/model/27021-micro-sd-label-sticks).\n\n- üïπÔ∏è I was surprised to learn how easy it is to get [The Full AMIGA Experience on Analogue Pocket](https://youtu.be/KURrNV7jupI?si=brG7PHl53uC_GAQB). Until now, I was also unaware that you can convert save states created with an emulator to and from the Pocket / MISTER: [Save File Converter](https://savefileconverter.com/#/mister).\n\n- üõ†Ô∏è I am actually very satisfied with [Anybox](https://anybox.app). Only sometimes I wish that the sync speed would be much faster. I recently archived 20,000 (!) old bookmarks and kept \"only\" the last 2k, which only helped to a limited extent in getting the bookmarks stored on the iPhone displayed faster on the Mac. Over the last few years, I've tried more or less all the alternatives, except for Link Cluster. Its developer [Daniel Witt](https://witt-software.com) is not an unknown[^1], the app was an up-front one-time purchase, and so far I have been hesitant to pay the money without knowing that the app does better than Anybox. That changed this week. A big update to [Version 2.0](https://www.witt-software.com/releasenotes/?app=linkcluster) has been released and you can now (very limited) test it first, which I will definitely do over the next week: [Link Cluster](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/link-cluster/id6443942506) - *Collect and manage links*.\n\n- üì∞ I checked out [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com) for macOS again. I will stick with [Reeder](https://reederapp.com) for the time being.\n\n- üíª I changed my window manager again. The app [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/), which has been used on my macOS for decades, has now been replaced by [Rectangle Pro](https://rectangleapp.com/pro). [Ryan Hanson](https://ryanhanson.dev) is another indie developer who releases just great utilities, and that's why I bought the Pro version right away. Alternatively, you can also use the free [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com) first. In fact, I can hardly imagine my life without [Superkey](https://superkey.app) (alternatively [Hyperkey](https://hyperkey.app)) anymore.\n\n- üì± No week without a new app from Sindre: [Doodle Draw](https://sindresorhus.com/doodle-draw).\n\n- üè† I hung a very inexpensive Amazon Kindle Fire tablet on the refrigerator a year or two ago and display in a Full Kiosk Browser [Magic Mirror2](https://magicmirror.builders), which runs on a Raspberry Pi. I programmed a series of small Python scripts that show me the energy consumption and our weekly changing family tasks, in addition to standard functions like family calendar, weather, date, time, etc. Unfortunately, I have forgotten most of what I taught myself with Python last year, and for some reason, Magic Mirror can no longer be updated without everything breaking afterwards.

It's a pity that [Actions for Obsidian](https://actions.work/actions-for-obsidian) didn't win. While looking at the entries, I stumbled upon [Data Visualization in Obsidian with Obsidian Charts](https://youtu.be/djj7QXZAIjM?si=eywCZXEaZMjyGh2r). There's simply nothing you can't do with Obsidian, albeit much more complicatedly than with other programs better suited for the task. I love that! ü§£\n\n- üîã If I ever think I need a big battery pack on the go, I might buy this one: [Shargeek 170: Unbeatable Power](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/shargeek-170-unbeatable-power-unparalleled-style#/).\n\n- ‚è∞ The idea of a location-based alarm clock for train rides or similar is great. But I believe I wouldn't have the confidence to rely on this solution: [WakeMeHere](https://apps.apple.com/app/wakemehere/id448033390) - A Location Alarm with Brain.\n\n- üìö I have been diligently reading [Holly](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL34057778W/Holly) - for my standards.

				"content_text": "\nIn continuation of week [01](https://mb.esamecar.net/2024/01/07/what-caught-my.html), here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in the second week of 2024:\n\n- üèãÔ∏è After my [Covid infection](https://mb.esamecar.net/2023/12/13/what-caught-my.html) in early December, followed by exhaustion, I started with a training program. It includes (indoor) cycling, strength training, and yoga sessions. It's exhausting, but it also feels good to finally be able to challenge my body a little again.\n\n- üìö Additionally, I wanted to read more, watch movies more regularly, meditate daily if possible, and do other nice little things more frequently. Therefore, I have started to enter these things as events in my calendar so that I don't lose sight of them.[^1] The first week has already gone quite well.\n\n- ü§ñ [Jarod Blundy](https://jb.heydingus.net/2024/01/12/i-just-updated.html) released an excellent Shortcut on [HeyDingus](https://heydingus.net/shortcuts/generate-alt-text-with-openai-vision). It *automatically generates an image description using OpenAI‚Äôs GPT4*. And if this was not enough, he released [Micro.blog Multimedia Uploader](https://heydingus.net/shortcuts/microblog-multimedia-uploader) - *upload any file to Micro.blog and format it for your blog post*. ü§©\n\n- üîó [Carlo](https://norden.social/@czottmann/111742655994401539) pointed to [Phanpy's excellent Mastodon thread viewer](https://forum.actions.work/t/open-mastodon-thread-in-phanpys-excellent-thread-viewer/258).\n\n- üíª I really enjoy all the [Apps](https://www.apptorium.com/apps) from Apptorium. Lots of great stuff available, mainly for macOS. They came up with a new app: [Cursor Teleporter](https://www.apptorium.com/blog/cursor-teleporter) - *Teleport your cursor across your displays*. In my lectures, I often struggle with moving and finding the cursor on the projector behind me; this app helps a lot to avoid that.\n\n- üìù [Obsidian](https://mas.to/@obsidian/111721992062128063) collected projects for its Gems of the Year 2023, and now the voting on their Discord has begun. Lots of interesting plugins. I already use some of them, but most were new to me.

I also really like the [linter](https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter) plugin - *an Obsidian plugin that formats and styles your notes with a focus on configurability and extensibility*.\n\n- üîñ Furthermore, I have bookmarked the following plugins to possibly come back to them at the right time: [canvas candy](https://tfthacker.com/canvas-candy), [dataloom](https://github.com/trey-wallis/obsidian-dataloom), [day planner](https://github.com/ivan-lednev/obsidian-day-planner), [easy bake](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-easy-bake), [folder notes](https://github.com/LostPaul/obsidian-folder-notes), [full calendar](https://davish.github.io/obsidian-full-calendar/), [git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git), [kanban](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban), [khoj](https://github.com/khoj-ai/khoj), [meta bind](https://github.com/mProjectsCode/obsidian-meta-bind-plugin), [modal form](https://github.com/danielo515/obsidian-modal-form), [latex suite](https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite), [obsidian to ical](https://github.com/andrewbrereton/obsidian-to-ical-plugin), [quickadd](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd), [smart connections](https://github.com/brianpetro/obsidian-smart-connections), and [time ruler](https://github.com/joshuatazrein/obsidian-time-ruler).\n\n- üéÆ It was mentioned on the last episode of [Hemispheric Views](https://hemisphericviews.com), [‚ÄéIdle Iktah](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/idle-iktah/id1631764038) - *Idle Iktah is an incremental* iOS *game set in a fictionalized Pacific Northwest where you start from nothing and create your own path to success*.

[Matt](https://isfeeling.social/@matt/111732443355317204) made a [video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=G1zFWFzKRUI) about it, if you're interested.\n\n- üé® Hiro posted these [Teenage Engineering iPhone Wallpapers](https://bylokki.gumroad.com/l/tewallaper) in his weeknotes. I am not into sequencer stuff at all (unfortunately, I am completely talentless when it comes to music) but they look awesome, nevertheless.\n\n- üì∫ Started watching [Slow Horses S3](https://trakt.tv/shows/slow-horses/seasons/3), [For All Mankind S4](https://trakt.tv/shows/for-all-mankind/seasons/4) and watched [Jiro Dreams of Sushi](https://trakt.tv/movies/jiro-dreams-of-sushi-2011).

And how crazy are these different [playing techniques](https://kottke.org/21/05/new-nes-tetris-technique)?\n\n- üê≠ I thought this would never happen: [Welcome to the public domain, Mickey Mouse](https://www.theverge.com/24006670/mickey-mouse-steamboat-willie-enters-copyright-public-domain-2024) - *Steamboat Willie finally slips out of copyright*.[^1] As a result, you can now watch [Steamboat Willie](https://ledbetter-games.itch.io/steamboat-willie) via [Playorama](https://hteumeuleu.itch.io/playorama) on your [Playdate](https://play.date), if you want to.\n\n- ü§î While [reviewing my subscriptions](https://mb.esamecar.net/2023/12/13/state-of-app.html), I had already considered canceling [kagi](https://kagi.com). [This](https://nileane.fr/@nileane/111705532073853768) made it easier for me, although I am aware that probably every search engine at least tolerates unethical practices indirectly or even practices them directly to some extent. My hope is that if service providers realize that such non-technical aspects are also relevant to customers, they will hopefully take them more into account in future decisions.\n\n- üì∫ Finished Season 2 of [The Bear](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/136315) and [Loki](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/84958) - loved both.\n\n- ü§Ø Watched [Oppenheimer](https://trakt.tv/movies/oppenheimer-2023) (2023) - and I wanted to be more [optimistic](https://mastodon.social/@kepano/111670149481580297) in 2024!\n\n[^1]: with many restrictions, of course\n",

href=\"https://mb.esamecar.net/2023/12/13/what-caught-my.html\">Until last week</a>, my standard password manager. I am currently considering whether it could potentially be replaced by Apple&rsquo;s Keychain; however, I am not fully there yet.</li>\n<li>üü¢ <a href=\"http://anybox.app\">Anybox</a>: My current bookmark manager of choice; I could possibly live with the free version of <a href=\"https://raindrop.io\">Raindrop.io</a>; but even though the developer probably <a href=\"https://nitter.net/raindrop_io/status/1550785806796742656\">no longer lives</a> in Russia, the <a href=\"https://numericcitizen.me/when-war-in-ukraine-influences-my-application-choices/\">proximity</a> is somehow still too uncomfortable for me.</li>\n<li>üü¢ <a href=\"https://www.arqbackup.com\">Arq</a>: I use Arq since 2016 together with the countless TB of free OneDrive storage space available to me as part of the MS Office subscription; I couldn&rsquo;t sleep peacefully without offsite backup.</li>\n<li>üü¢ <a href=\"https://chroniclingapp.com\">Chronicling</a>: I use it a lot lately, especially to fill my Daily Journal in Obsidian via Shortcuts.app; I really don&rsquo;t want to miss it.</li>\n<li>üü° <a href=\"https://dayoneapp.com\">DayOne</a>: Since I moved my Daily Journal to Obsidian in the middle of the year, I don&rsquo;t really use it anymore. But I still let it be filled (automatically). My first entries go back to the year 2008, although I can&rsquo;t figure out when it was actually published. Would feel strange without it.</li>\n<li>üü¢ <a href=\"https://getdrafts.com\">Drafts</a>: I used the app extensively in the past, then didn&rsquo;t understand it for a long time, and currently, I can&rsquo;t imagine life without it again.</li>\n<li>üü¢ <a href=\"https://www.epicrideweather.com\">Epic Weather Ride</a>: An indispensable weather tool for planning bike tours.</li>\n<li>üî¥ <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/fddb-kalorienz%C3%A4hler-di%C3%A4t/id1105332761\">FDDB</a>: I regularly fail to track my calories consistently and thus control my weight. Most of the year an unused app because it is too exhausting to constantly weigh your food. I should cancel and only resubscribe when I really (for a month or two) want to use it.</li>\n<li>üü¢ <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/healthfit/id1202650514\">HealthFit</a>: One of the few ways to get .fit files from the <a href=\"https://www.hammerhead.io\">Hammerhead Karoo 2</a> into Apple Health and much more. Subscription is even voluntary and IMHO extremely well invested.</li>\n<li>üü° <a href=\"http://iconnecthue.com\">iConnectHue</a>: An alternative way to program and control Philips Hue lamps. In the past, the things I wanted to implement could only be set up properly through it. However, I should take a look during the brighter time of the year to see if most of it can now also be done via the native app.</li>\n<li>üü° <a href=\"http://ifttt.com\">ifttt</a>: Oh, I actually only use it to import various things into Day One automatically. I don&rsquo;t really need it but I love automating things ü§î.</li>\n<li>üü¢ <a href=\"https://tapbots.com/ivory/\">Ivory</a>: There are a number of alternative Mastodon clients like <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mona-for-mastodon/id1659154653\">Mona</a> etc. that do not rely on a subscription; also, the development speed is not very high at the moment. On the other hand, I&rsquo;ve gotten very used to these very polished apps for iOS and macOS.</li>\n<li>üü° <a href=\"http://kagi.com\">Kagi</a>: A really good Google alternative. But ultimately &ldquo;only&rdquo; for the conscience. It&rsquo;s not that I achieve anything with Kagi that wouldn&rsquo;t be possible with google.com or <a href=\"http://duckduckgo.com\">duckduckgo</a>.</li>\n<li>üî¥ <a href=\"https://upaheadapp.com\">Up Ahead</a>: Incredible nice-looking app, but I feel like it hasn&rsquo;t been updated for almost a year now. (How nice it would be if you could simply add  entries from the calendar.) It&rsquo;s hard, but</li>\n<li>üü¢ <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/mastodon\">Mastodon</a>: Completely voluntary and actually too small an amount.</li>\n<li>üî¥ <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mercury-weather/id1621800675\">Mercury Weather</a>: I really like it, it has even won big at the <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2023-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/\">MacStories Selects</a>, but since I rarely travel to other places/countries and the Weather app is also getting better&hellip;</li>\n<li>üü¢ <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">Micro.blog</a> : What can I say &hellip;</li>\n<li>üî¥ <a href=\"https://www.mindnode.com\">Mindnode</a>: Used to be one of my most used apps; it is now also available via Setapp and I only have the subscription because of the iOS version; however, I use the latter very rarely ATM.</li>\n<li>üü° MS Office 365: In the meantime, my sons through school as well as my wife and I through work theoretically have free access to Office at home, however, I paid for several years in advance a long time ago and now the subscription just runs. I use the storage space intensively with Arq (see above); I should check at some point whether it can be realized more cheaply.</li>\n<li>üü¢ <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/neptunes/id1006739057?mt=12\">Neptunes</a>: Costs almost nothing and I use it daily on the Mac.</li>\n<li>üü¢ <a href=\"https://nordvpn.com/\">NordVPN</a>: Everyone should have a VPN service, right?</li>\n<li>üü¢ <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/sync\">Obsidian Sync</a>: Without Obsidian, my computer life would be meaningless right now. There would be alternatives to synchronize the content between platforms, but the Sync subscription is a good way to support Obsidian in its entirety.</li>\n<li>üî¥ <a href=\"https://overcast.fm\">Overcast Premium</a>: I never understood the UI concept of Overcast. However, it has Shortcuts support and I have automated a few things with it. Are they really necessary? No.</li>\n<li>üî¥ <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/personal-best-workouts/id1510256676\">Personal Best</a>: Nice, but the UI is still a bit too confusing for me and the actual benefit may be too small.</li>\n<li>üü° <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/play-save-videos-watch-later/id1596506190\">Play</a>: I&rsquo;ll take a look at it again in a year. Right now, I really enjoy the channels feature <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/play-2-0-adds-youtube-channel-support-folders-and-a-new-premium-subscription/\">introduced in 2.0</a>.</li>\n<li>üî¥ <a href=\"https://www.pixelmator.com/photomator/\">Photomator</a>: Great app, but I don&rsquo;t use it often enough.</li>\n<li>üü° <a href=\"https://readwise.io/read\">Reader Readwise</a>: The price is at the upper limit of pain for me but only thanks to an educational discount. I use the app very extensively; if it were more expensive, I would switch to <a href=\"http://omnivore.app\">Omnivore</a>.</li>\n<li>üü¢ <a href=\"https://setapp.com/de\">Setapp</a>: Worth the money thanks to the Edu discount.</li>\n<li>üî¥ <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/s%C3%B6ka-bucket-lists-made-easy/id6446223795\">S√∂ka</a>: I like it.

I am currently considering whether it could potentially be replaced by Apple's Keychain; however, I am not fully there yet.\n- üü¢ [Anybox](http://anybox.app): My current bookmark manager of choice; I could possibly live with the free version of [Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io); but even though the developer probably [no longer lives](https://nitter.net/raindrop_io/status/1550785806796742656) in Russia, the [proximity](https://numericcitizen.me/when-war-in-ukraine-influences-my-application-choices/) is somehow still too uncomfortable for me. \n- üü¢ [Arq](https://www.arqbackup.com): I use Arq since 2016 together with the countless TB of free OneDrive storage space available to me as part of the MS Office subscription; I couldn't sleep peacefully without offsite backup. \n- üü¢ [Chronicling](https://chroniclingapp.com): I use it a lot lately, especially to fill my Daily Journal in Obsidian via Shortcuts.app; I really don't want to miss it. \n- üü° [DayOne](https://dayoneapp.com): Since I moved my Daily Journal to Obsidian in the middle of the year, I don't really use it anymore. But I still let it be filled (automatically). My first entries go back to the year 2008, although I can't figure out when it was actually published. Would feel strange without it.\n- üü¢ [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com): I used the app extensively in the past, then didn't understand it for a long time, and currently, I can't imagine life without it again. \n- üü¢ [Epic Weather Ride](https://www.epicrideweather.com): An indispensable weather tool for planning bike tours. \n- üî¥ [FDDB](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/fddb-kalorienz%C3%A4hler-di%C3%A4t/id1105332761): I regularly fail to track my calories consistently and thus control my weight. Most of the year an unused app because it is too exhausting to constantly weigh your food. I should cancel and only resubscribe when I really (for a month or two) want to use it.\n- üü¢ [HealthFit](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/healthfit/id1202650514): One of the few ways to get .fit files from the [Hammerhead Karoo 2](https://www.hammerhead.io) into Apple Health and much more. Subscription is even voluntary and IMHO extremely well invested. \n- üü° [iConnectHue](http://iconnecthue.com): An alternative way to program and control Philips Hue lamps. In the past, the things I wanted to implement could only be set up properly through it. However, I should take a look during the brighter time of the year to see if most of it can now also be done via the native app. \n- üü° [ifttt](http://ifttt.com): Oh, I actually only use it to import various things into Day One automatically. I don't really need it but I love automating things ü§î. \n- üü¢ [Ivory](https://tapbots.com/ivory/): There are a number of alternative Mastodon clients like [Mona](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mona-for-mastodon/id1659154653) etc. that do not rely on a subscription; also, the development speed is not very high at the moment. On the other hand, I've gotten very used to these very polished apps for iOS and macOS. \n- üü° [Kagi](http://kagi.com): A really good Google alternative. But ultimately \"only\" for the conscience. It's not that I achieve anything with Kagi that wouldn't be possible with google.com or [duckduckgo](http://duckduckgo.com). \n- üî¥ [Up Ahead](https://upaheadapp.com): Incredible nice-looking app, but I feel like it hasn't been updated for almost a year now. (How nice it would be if you could simply add  entries from the calendar.) It's hard, but \n- üü¢ [Mastodon](https://www.patreon.com/mastodon): Completely voluntary and actually too small an amount. \n- üî¥ [Mercury Weather](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mercury-weather/id1621800675): I really like it, it has even won big at the [MacStories Selects](https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2023-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/), but since I rarely travel to other places/countries and the Weather app is also getting better... \n- üü¢ [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) : What can I say ...\n- üî¥ [Mindnode](https://www.mindnode.com): Used to be one of my most used apps; it is now also available via Setapp and I only have the subscription because of the iOS version; however, I use the latter very rarely ATM. \n- üü° MS Office 365: In the meantime, my sons through school as well as my wife and I through work theoretically have free access to Office at home, however, I paid for several years in advance a long time ago and now the subscription just runs. I use the storage space intensively with Arq (see above); I should check at some point whether it can be realized more cheaply. \n- üü¢ [Neptunes](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/neptunes/id1006739057?mt=12): Costs almost nothing and I use it daily on the Mac. \n- üü¢ [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/): Everyone should have a VPN service, right? \n- üü¢ [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync): Without Obsidian, my computer life would be meaningless right now. There would be alternatives to synchronize the content between platforms, but the Sync subscription is a good way to support Obsidian in its entirety. \n- üî¥ [Overcast Premium](https://overcast.fm): I never understood the UI concept of Overcast. However, it has Shortcuts support and I have automated a few things with it. Are they really necessary? No. \n- üî¥ [Personal Best](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/personal-best-workouts/id1510256676): Nice, but the UI is still a bit too confusing for me and the actual benefit may be too small. \n- üü° [Play](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/play-save-videos-watch-later/id1596506190): I'll take a look at it again in a year. Right now, I really enjoy the channels feature [introduced in 2.0](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/play-2-0-adds-youtube-channel-support-folders-and-a-new-premium-subscription/). \n- üî¥ [Photomator](https://www.pixelmator.com/photomator/): Great app, but I don't use it often enough. \n- üü° [Reader Readwise](https://readwise.io/read): The price is at the upper limit of pain for me but only thanks to an educational discount. I use the app very extensively; if it were more expensive, I would switch to [Omnivore](http://omnivore.app). \n- üü¢ [Setapp](https://setapp.com/de): Worth the money thanks to the Edu discount. \n- üî¥ [S√∂ka](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/s√∂ka-bucket-lists-made-easy/id6446223795): I like it. I travel too little to really take advantage of it. Maybe I'll subscribe for a month or so before the next vacation? \n- üü° [Timery](https://timeryapp.com): I use it professionally, but I pay for it privately because it helps me keep a little better track. \n- üü° [trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv/vip): Actually, I watch too few series to justify a VIP account. But in this way, things can be automated very nicely and transferred to Day One via IFTT, etc. Oh ... \n- üî¥ [Training Today](https://trainingtodayapp.com): After the app once attested to me the best fitness despite fever and malaise, I believe it is just an (expensive) random number generator. \n- üü¢ [TV Forecast](https://tvforecastapp.com): I love this app. \n- [Waterllama](https://waterllama.com): I have now bought a Live Time license.\n- üü¢ [YNAB](https://www.ynab.com): Without YNAB, we would be heavily in debt, I would have even more pointless stuff, and my wife would have left me with the kids and dog. \n- üü° [Zenitizer](https://manuelkehl.com/apps/zenitizer/): The subscription reminds me that I damn well need to work on overcoming my inner laziness more regularly. \n- üü¢ Apple One Premium: As a family, we need a large iCloud storage tier just for the photos. In addition, we use Apple Music and Apple TV+. In total, still more expensive than Premium. It's a pity, really. \n- üü¢ Disney+: Marvel, Star Wars, etc. - we can't do without it. \n- üü° [Nintendo Switch Online](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Nintendo-Switch-Online/Benefits/Benefits-2060569.html): Necessary just for my son's ZELDA backup, although üòà ... \n- üü° [PlayStationPlus](https://www.playstation.com/ps-plus/): If I could understand what exactly happens to my 300 previously \"acquired\" games through it if I were to cancel it, it might even be conceivable to do so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. \n- üü¢ [wahoo X](https://uk.wahoofitness.com/wahoo-x-membership): The Zwift UI has too negative an impact on my blood pressure; I have therefore been looking for a long time for an alternative to indoor cycling that just works reliably. The Sufferfest / wahoo SYSTM does this. My way of exercising in the winter months. \n\nWell, there are a few programs / services that I have now canceled as a result. I still have to think about the other üü° apps. It would probably be wise to cancel them as well and after the subscription expires, see if I can bear their loss and if not, just resubscribe.\n\nBut basically, nice things cost money and all these services and apps make my day easier or enrich my life.

But even better is <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@jackwellborn/111539651190313429\">the tip</a> from <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@jackwellborn\">Jack Wellborn</a>, that you can easily drag and drop multiple tabs into a new window.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>üìù I have been doing most of my (transformative) text work with BBEdit for decades. I really wouldn‚Äôt know what to do with my life without Multi-File Search and Regex, but sometimes I also like to use <a href=\"https://retina.studio/textbuddy/\">TextBuddy</a> or <a href=\"https://www.gtrigonakis.com/textworkflow\">Text Workflow</a>.

In keeping with this, John Romero released <a href=\"https://romero.com/sigil\">SIGIL II</a>. Speaking of Miyoo mini plus - there is now a <a href=\"https://github.com/XK9274/pico-8-wrapper-miyoo\">native pico-8 wrapper</a>, too ü•≥.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>üëæ I started playing <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0301905/\">Super Mario Advance</a> (GBA) on my Analogue Pocket. I noticed that I definitely never played Super Mario Bros. 2 before. (I could have sworn that I had at least tried all the major releases.) You can tell that the second part is a reskin and somehow it doesn&rsquo;t really fit into the series. I also find it absurdly difficult already in the third / fourth world. Let&rsquo;s see how far I will get in the game.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>üéÆ I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a coincidence or due to the recently released firmware updates, but lately my Playstation Portal has been running absolutely smoothly ü•∞</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>üßµ Unfortunately, I now have to crawl out of <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@gruber/110667962169426329\">my European library</a> again, because soon <a href=\"https://www.threads.net\">the fun begins here too</a>!

I think I will actually export all my subscribed podcasts, delete Overcast, and in Apple Podcasts, subscribe to <a href=\"https://ruminatepodcast.com\">Ruminate</a> and <a href=\"https://hemisphericviews.com\">Hemispheric Views</a>, and then consider whether and which <a href=\"https://flamedfury.com/posts/my-podcast-rotation-keeping-it-at-four/\">other two</a> of the usual suspects I choose.

				"content_text": "\nIn continuation of week [48](https://mb.esamecar.net/2023/12/03/what-caught-my.html), here are a few thoughts and things that caught my attention in week 49, 2023:\n\n- ü¶† Yes, I had already feared it, and unfortunately, it happened: My wife's Covid-19 infection did not pass me by. Therefore, my weeknote is regrettably appearing a little too late \"this week.\"\n\n- üî´ You may not necessarily like the content, but technically, the [trailer for GTA VI](https://youtube.com/watch?v=QdBZY2fkU-0) definitely blew me away.\n\n- ‚úèÔ∏è Another PDF editor that I will look at in my long search for an alternative to Preview[^1] is [PDFgear](https://www.pdfgear.com) - *PDF Tasks Made Easy.*[^2]\n\n- ü™ü [Gruber released](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/05/an-applescript-for-safari-split-tabs-to-new-window) *An AppleScript for Safari to move all tabs in the frontmost window, from the current tab to the rightmost (last) tab, to a new window*: [Split Tabs to New Window.scpt](https://gist.github.com/gruber/eb89728474ba59287df79c054e1097a5). But even better is [the tip](https://mastodon.social/@jackwellborn/111539651190313429) from [Jack Wellborn](https://mastodon.social/@jackwellborn), that you can easily drag and drop multiple tabs into a new window.\n\n- üìù I have been doing most of my (transformative) text work with BBEdit for decades. I really wouldn‚Äôt know what to do with my life without Multi-File Search and Regex, but sometimes I also like to use [TextBuddy](https://retina.studio/textbuddy/) or [Text Workflow](https://www.gtrigonakis.com/textworkflow). Another nice app that does something similar is by [Chris Hannah](https://fosstodon.org/@chrishannah) and now apparently even free for iOS and macOS: [Text Case](https://textcase.app).\n\n- üìù While I'm on the topic of text editors. [CotEditor](https://coteditor.com) now also has a Quick Action Bar - if only the programs could agree on a uniform shortcut!\n\n- üïπ For the 30th anniversary of Doom, I [bought it again](https://www.gog.com/de/game/doom_1993) and immediately installed it [on my MacBook](https://www.paulfioravanti.com/blog/classic-doom-mac/) and [Miyoo mini plus](https://github.com/OnionUI/Ports-Collection). In keeping with this, John Romero released [SIGIL II](https://romero.com/sigil). Speaking of Miyoo mini plus - there is now a [native pico-8 wrapper](https://github.com/XK9274/pico-8-wrapper-miyoo), too ü•≥.\n\n- üëæ I started playing [Super Mario Advance](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0301905/) (GBA) on my Analogue Pocket. I noticed that I definitely never played Super Mario Bros. 2 before. (I could have sworn that I had at least tried all the major releases.) You can tell that the second part is a reskin and somehow it doesn't really fit into the series. I also find it absurdly difficult already in the third / fourth world. Let's see how far I will get in the game.\n\n- üéÆ I don't know if it's a coincidence or due to the recently released firmware updates, but lately my Playstation Portal has been running absolutely smoothly ü•∞\n\n- üßµ Unfortunately, I now have to crawl out of [my European library](https://mastodon.social/@gruber/110667962169426329) again, because soon [the fun begins here too](https://www.threads.net)! (However, I will continue to ignore Threads, just like Facebook and Instagram, for the time being.)\n\n- ‚ÜîÔ∏è In terms of features, it's not yet an alternative to Kaleidoscope, but it's affordable: [Text Differ](https://proxymanstore.gumroad.com/l/textdiffer) - *Meet Text Differ, a native macOS app that shows beautiful differences between 2 texts.*\n\n- üéô Lately, I was a little annoyed by the ever-same content in my overflowing podcast subscription list. I think I will actually export all my subscribed podcasts, delete Overcast, and in Apple Podcasts, subscribe to [Ruminate](https://ruminatepodcast.com) and [Hemispheric Views](https://hemisphericviews.com), and then consider whether and which [other two](https://flamedfury.com/posts/my-podcast-rotation-keeping-it-at-four/) of the usual suspects I choose. Also, I [followed Robb's advice](https://rknight.me/smart-speed-broke-my-brain/) and turned off Smart Speed and reset the playback speed to 1.0.\n\n- üõë I have now forbidden 1Password on all my devices from wanting to fill anything anywhere and only use it as a (backup) vault. I have exported all my passwords from 1PW into the Apple Keychain[^4], and my life has become significantly less annoying. I'm going to look at this for a few weeks now and then consider whether I completely get rid of 1PW or keep it running alongside.\n\n- üñäÔ∏è iOS 17.2 was released, and with it the Journal.app. I can't do anything with the app itself, but [DayOne is allowed to use the same API](https://dayoneapp.com/blog/introducing-journaling-suggestions/) and can suggest the same things. That's cool![^3]\n\n- ‚åö watchOS 10.2 has brought back the ability to change Watch Faces by simple swiping. Thank you, Apple! I had to search for quite a while until I finally understood that this setting can only be made on the watch itself: `Settings > Clock > Swipe to Switch Watch Face`\n\n[^1]: In the past, I have suffered significant data loss after annotating PDFs with Preview.app, and since then, I no longer trust the application. Thank you, Apple.\n[^2]: However, I have not yet really understood their monetization concept.\n[^3]: At the moment, I primarily keep my Daily Journal in Obsidian but transfer a copy of it to Day One via Shortcuts.app; I need to rethink my use of Day One separately.\n[^4]: Of course, Safari crashed immediately during import; whoever is responsible for software quality at Apple, in my opinion, should be fired.\n",

I never know if I'm just too stupid to tick the right boxes, or if I've stumbled upon another bug again.\n",

Yesterday it suddenly stopped connecting to my MacBook Pro (M1). It was listed, but clicking on connect did nothing. I made macOS Ventura forget the device and tried to reconnect it, but to no avail. I shut down the keyboard and rebooted everything, still no luck. I held the power button on the keyboard (no cable to connect with) until it flashed, tried several new batteries, asked the internet and just could not find a solution. </p>\n<p>It turned out that I had to press and hold the power button on my keyboard until it went into pairing mode, and <strong>I had to hold it down throughout the entire setup process</strong>, even while entering the pairing code (it did not even show up with my other approaches, only spinning indicators resulting in dead ends). I am 100% certain that I have never performed such an acrobatic dance to connect a keyboard to a computer before. But maybe I'm going senile.</p>\n",

I took the opportunity to completely reinstall the system. Most of it is now up and running, but <a href=\"https://www.python.org\">Python 3</a> was still missing. Python is a programming language that even I understand to some extent, but the installation is an absolute mess. This time I first installed <a href=\"https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv\">pyenv</a> via <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">Homebrew</a> and then Python. Maybe then the handling of the different versions won't slip through my fingers quite so quickly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python_environment.png\" alt=\"xkcd comic Python Environment\" title=\"xkcd comic Python Environment\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>‚úÖ From time to time, I try to replace certain apps with Apple's own and see if they are now so good that I can do without third-party apps. A few weeks ago, I tried this with task management. I've been a <a href=\"https://culturedcode.com/things/\">Things</a> user since day one, managing both my work and personal tasks. Later, it became too confusing and I wanted to separate work and private tasks. I then used <a href=\"https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus\">OmniFocus</a> for work and Things for my private life. Unfortunately, the Siri integration via the Apple Watch didn't work well, especially because Siri doesn't understand English terms, like \"Things\" on German-language systems. Therefore, Siri never understood to which app I want to add a task to. That's why I gave up on Things a few years ago and used Apple's Reminders app for my private tasks. Thanks to smart lists, tags etc. I thought that I could possibly also manage my professional tasks with Reminders. But two weeks later I realised that this is not yet an option for me. The filter options for the smart lists are too limited, because you can't, for example, include one list and exclude another.

In addition, I wanted to completely abstain from alcohol for a month. Both worked out well. I'm sticking to meatless dinners and I've also stopped drinking a delicious pale ale or something else during the week. I think that can't hurt in the end. Since this has worked so well, I have come up with two new things for February: no sweets, chocolate, cakes or similar foods with a lot of added sugar. And additionally, no coffee. I had real withdrawal symptoms for the first two or three days (headache, fatigue, slight aching limbs). It's so hard for me to do without a delicious coffee in the morning. But well, there are only a good two weeks left. I don't know yet what nonsense I'll come up with for next month.  ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</li>\n</ul>\n",

It was a rather intimate podcast. And both the developers of the <a href=\"https://darknoise.app\">Darknoise</a> app and <a href=\"https://sofahq.com\">Sofa</a> seem to be very nice people. After what they said about <strong>software subscriptions</strong>, I&rsquo;m afraid that sooner or later all apps will have to switch to the subscription model. I personally don&rsquo;t like that, but if there&rsquo;s no other way for indie developers, you probably have to think about what you&rsquo;re willing to spend per year and then keep an eye on your subscriptions, e.g. with <a href=\"https://bobbyapp.co\">Bobby</a>, and limit them accordingly.</li>\n<li>üõãÔ∏è Speaking of <a href=\"https://sofahq.com\">Sofa</a>. I really like the app, but I think I&rsquo;ll try to stay away from software and services where it&rsquo;s not possible to get your data out again with open standards, an API or at least an RSS feed.</li>\n<li>ü´∞ Speaking of subscriptions, after all this <a href=\"https://mas.to/@dcrainmaker/109761992004211636\">back and forth</a>, I <strong>cancelled my Strava subscription</strong>. I&rsquo;ll see if I can enjoy cycling without all their pro features.</li>\n<li>üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Speaking of (I know, I know &hellip;) cycling, once again I have felt annoyed, no, <strong>threatened by SUV</strong> drivers. I really don&rsquo;t know where all this is going. Fittingly, the <a href=\"https://indieweb.social/@magalhini/109739198359436268\">post</a> about the size of cars.</li>\n<li>üêò I had a look at <strong><a href=\"https://social.shadowfacts.net/objects/25db7fa3-31e5-46aa-a534-643de7617f8e\">Tusker</a></strong>, a new iOS Mastodon client. It&rsquo;s still fun to see all these many ideas for Mastodon clients. There hasn&rsquo;t been so much dynamism in the scene for a long time. Even though <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ice-cubes-for-mastodon/id6444915884\">IceCube</a> gets a lot of praise, I keep coming back to <a href=\"https://tapbots.com/ivory/\">Ivory</a>, which was finally released in the App Store this week. You can only have missed it, though, if you&rsquo;ve been living under a rock. Even though I find the development speed of IceCube absolutely remarkable and the app is certainly one of the most impressive in terms of features, I am still bothered by the many small bugs and especially the bad scrolling performance. (I think SwiftUI might be the one to blame here.) Ivory, on the other hand, is really fast and performant. The great thing is that you can change at any time.</li>\n<li>üïπÔ∏è I&rsquo;ve played the two new <strong>playdate games</strong> that were released for me this week: <a href=\"https://play.date/games/flipper-lifter/\">Flipper Lifter</a> and <a href=\"https://play.date/games/echoic-memory/\">Echoic Memory</a>. I am really bad at audio and don&rsquo;t know if I enjoy Echoic Memory and I haven&rsquo;t found any access to Flipper Lifter yet. In general, with some playdate games, I sometimes feel like I don&rsquo;t really understand the mechanics of the game, and just do anything that will somehow get me to the goal. I sometimes wish the games would introduce you a little more and not leave you completely out in the cold.</li>\n<li>üïπÔ∏è In the end, everything was overshadowed by the fact that my <strong>playdate</strong> probably <strong>has</strong> a <strong>faulty battery</strong>. I have, surprisingly unexpectedly, received an answer from <a href=\"https://social.panic.com/@cabel/109757052741921514\">Cabel</a>, but unfortunately not yet from support. They seem to be quite overwhelmed by support requests right now.</li>\n<li>üì± On <strong>iOS</strong>, I looked at <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1489443070\">Countdown to Anything!</a> but I think I&rsquo;ll stick with <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/countdowns-termine-verfolgen/id917514700\">Countdowns</a>.</li>\n<li>üì± This <a href=\"https://social.lol/@inkeduprunner/109744118273037005\">screenshot</a> of Jason&rsquo;s homescreen inspired me to tinker a little bit with <a href=\"https://social.lol/@inkeduprunner/109744118273037005\">Widgy</a>. I also bought <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/opener-open-links-in-apps/id989565871\">Opener</a>, don&rsquo;t know why üòá</li>\n<li>üíª On the <strong>Mac</strong>, I&rsquo;ve been looking at the new <a href=\"https://thebrowser.company\">Arc</a> browser, which is kind of hyped right now. I really don&rsquo;t know why though. I have a bit of a suspicion that it might just be the invite system. To me, the browser seems extremely sluggish. My password management and Apple Pay don&rsquo;t work, which is probably not the browser&rsquo;s fault. It&rsquo;s too early to judge, but so far I always go back to Safari after a short time.</li>\n<li>üíª It came to my mind, that you can use Markdown links of <a href=\"https://mastodon.cloud/@cogsciapps/109758770719895321\">hooked</a> items together with <a href=\"https://sindresorhus.com/one-thing\">One Thing</a>, an App that I really enjoy.

It was a rather intimate podcast. And both the developers of the [Darknoise](https://darknoise.app) app and [Sofa](https://sofahq.com) seem to be very nice people. After what they said about **software subscriptions**, I'm afraid that sooner or later all apps will have to switch to the subscription model. I personally don't like that, but if there's no other way for indie developers, you probably have to think about what you're willing to spend per year and then keep an eye on your subscriptions, e.g. with [Bobby](https://bobbyapp.co), and limit them accordingly.\n- üõãÔ∏è Speaking of [Sofa](https://sofahq.com). I really like the app, but I think I'll try to stay away from software and services where it's not possible to get your data out again with open standards, an API or at least an RSS feed.\n- ü´∞ Speaking of subscriptions, after all this [back and forth](https://mas.to/@dcrainmaker/109761992004211636), I **cancelled my Strava subscription**. I'll see if I can enjoy cycling without all their pro features.\n- üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Speaking of (I know, I know ...) cycling, once again I have felt annoyed, no, **threatened by SUV** drivers. I really don't know where all this is going. Fittingly, the [post](https://indieweb.social/@magalhini/109739198359436268) about the size of cars.\n- üêò I had a look at **[Tusker](https://social.shadowfacts.net/objects/25db7fa3-31e5-46aa-a534-643de7617f8e)**, a new iOS Mastodon client. It's still fun to see all these many ideas for Mastodon clients. There hasn't been so much dynamism in the scene for a long time. Even though [IceCube](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ice-cubes-for-mastodon/id6444915884) gets a lot of praise, I keep coming back to [Ivory](https://tapbots.com/ivory/), which was finally released in the App Store this week. You can only have missed it, though, if you've been living under a rock. Even though I find the development speed of IceCube absolutely remarkable and the app is certainly one of the most impressive in terms of features, I am still bothered by the many small bugs and especially the bad scrolling performance. (I think SwiftUI might be the one to blame here.) Ivory, on the other hand, is really fast and performant. The great thing is that you can change at any time.\n-  üïπÔ∏è I've played the two new **playdate games** that were released for me this week: [Flipper Lifter](https://play.date/games/flipper-lifter/) and [Echoic Memory](https://play.date/games/echoic-memory/). I am really bad at audio and don't know if I enjoy Echoic Memory and I haven't found any access to Flipper Lifter yet. In general, with some playdate games, I sometimes feel like I don't really understand the mechanics of the game, and just do anything that will somehow get me to the goal. I sometimes wish the games would introduce you a little more and not leave you completely out in the cold. \n- üïπÔ∏è In the end, everything was overshadowed by the fact that my **playdate** probably **has** a **faulty battery**. I have, surprisingly unexpectedly, received an answer from [Cabel](https://social.panic.com/@cabel/109757052741921514), but unfortunately not yet from support. They seem to be quite overwhelmed by support requests right now.\n- üì± On **iOS**, I looked at [Countdown to Anything!](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1489443070) but I think I'll stick with [Countdowns](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/countdowns-termine-verfolgen/id917514700). \n- üì± This [screenshot](https://social.lol/@inkeduprunner/109744118273037005) of Jason's homescreen inspired me to tinker a little bit with [Widgy](https://social.lol/@inkeduprunner/109744118273037005). I also bought [Opener](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/opener-open-links-in-apps/id989565871), don't know why üòá\n- üíª On the **Mac**, I've been looking at the new [Arc](https://thebrowser.company) browser, which is kind of hyped right now. I really don't know why though. I have a bit of a suspicion that it might just be the invite system. To me, the browser seems extremely sluggish. My password management and Apple Pay don't work, which is probably not the browser's fault. It's too early to judge, but so far I always go back to Safari after a short time. \n- üíª It came to my mind, that you can use Markdown links of [hooked](https://mastodon.cloud/@cogsciapps/109758770719895321) items together with [One Thing](https://sindresorhus.com/one-thing), an App that I really enjoy. It gives you one click menu bar item to the one file you are just working on.\n- üíª I had a look at [HiDock, for Mac](https://hidock.app/) and [Lasso - Window Manager for macOS](https://thelasso.app/).\n- üíª Thanks to [Matthew](https://social.lol/@mken/109750124058233654) I became aware of [Menubar X](https://menubarx.app) ([Setapp](https://setapp.com/de/apps/menubarx)).

So there was less to discover. I did a lot of walking with the dog (~ 50 km from Monday to Saturday so far), so at least I had enough time to listen to podcasts:<ul>\n<li>üéôÔ∏è I really enjoyed <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+6u827rjC0\">Really Specific Stories: John Siracusa</a>. A podcast I did not know about before. This was a very intimate conversation and I discovered so much of myself in what was told. Unfortunately, I can't even begin to speak with such reflection and eloquence. There's definitely a reason I'm not a podcaster, and an absolutely insignificant little fish otherwise. What I also found very interesting was <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+B7ND0zcCY\">The Talk Show: ‚ÄòSlow-Moving Hurricane‚Äô, With Craig Hockenberry</a>. I only knew Craig Hockenberry from <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@chockenberry\">his posts and profile picture</a>. I was very surprised to listen to such a level-headed, reflective person. It's always exciting what impressions you get about people just by reading about them or listening to them. The episode <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+6u81QBHHQ\">Really Specific Stories: Jason Burk</a> fit in very well with this. I'm already looking forward to the others.</li>\n<li>üéôÔ∏è Parallel to the release of the two new games <a href=\"https://play.date/games/lost-your-marbles/\">Lost Your Marbles</a> and <a href=\"https://play.date/games/pickpackpup/\">Pick Pack Pup</a> in Series 1 for <a href=\"https://esamecar.net/2023/01/07/playdate.html\">my playdate</a> I listened to the respective podcast episodes: <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+5Ddo1eC7M\">Playdate Podcast: Pick Pack Pup</a> and <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+5DdrMprw0\">Playdate Podcast: Lost Your Marbles</a>. </li>\n<li>üéôÔ∏è Additionally I've listened to <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+Fcm_P4vGY\">Upgrade: 441: Qi2: Qi Harder</a>, <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+I5CmMcSjU\">AppStories: Read-Later Apps</a>, <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+Fcm-buxIs\">Upgrade: 442: Zombie Arms and Toaster Fridge</a>, <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+FgnYjcuX0\">Under the Radar: 260: Subscription School</a> and <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+FXx6P7vZI\">Connected: 433: The Best Alarm is the Alarm</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For these posts, I was looking for a way to log the podcast episodes I was listening to, but couldn't find a way to look them up in <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/\">Overcast</a>. So I wrote a Shortcuts script that logs the currently playing episode to a Drafts document after 30 seconds.</li>\n<li>ü•ò Speaking of the Shortcuts app. I love <a href=\"https://mela.recipes\">Mela</a> and in my family we use <a href=\"https://www.ponlist.de\">Pon</a> for shopping lists. Unfortunately, there is no way to export shopping lists directly from Mela to Pon. And it is not possible to import the corresponding Reminders list into Pon. So I put together a little <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/9c1fa9b21f574dfd81d65e8ae55e8305\">shortcut</a> that somehow does the job.</li>\n<li>‚ù§Ô∏è I was playing around with my <a href=\"https://now.esamecar.net\">omg/now</a> page.</li>\n<li>üíª I bought <a href=\"https://www.houdah.com/photosWorkbench/\">Photos Workbench</a>. I think I will mainly use it to compare and select pictures. I really miss a corresponding function in the Photos app. I have looked a lot for alternatives and had even subscribed to Lightroom in the meantime. But that's a complete overkill and I don't want to have any more software from that company. That's why I'm happy that an app has now been released that will hopefully take care of that.</li>\n<li>üïπÔ∏è Played <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/pick-pack-pup/3030-82889/\">Pick Pack Pup (2022)</a> and the first ten levels of <a href=\"https://social.lol/@esamecar/109727415412705797\">Gravity Express</a>. The former is fine but I did not fell in love so far. The latter ist very similar to <a href=\"https://possiblyaxolotl.itch.io/rocketbytes\">Rocket Bytes</a> but Gravity Express has checkpoints, tasks, fuel, etc. I seems not that hardcore as the other.</li>\n<li>üóºStumbled across <a href=\"https://lantern.rknight.me\">Lantern</a>. </li>\n<li>Bought <a href=\"https://mstdn.plus/@lapcatsoftware/109718227833446585\">Homecoming for Mastodon</a>. I think this can easily be done via Shortcuts too but anyways ...</li>\n<li>üì∫ No TV, now movies this week üò¢</li>\n<li>üßäGave the <a href=\"https://github.com/Dimillian/IceCubesApp\">IceCubeApp</a> beta another try. Unlike many others, I'm not warming up to the app. It has too many little bugs that make it hard for me to use it regularly. But of course, the whole <a href=\"https://social.lol/@esamecar/109717531311835254\">App Store approval saga</a> was funny - or rather the opposite.</li>\n<li>üéôÔ∏è<a href=\"https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper/large\">MacWhisper</a>: It's absolutely impressive what's now possible.</li>\n<li>üí¨ Too much <a href=\"https://social.lol/@esamecar\">Mastodon</a> but I really like it there.

I have just discovered that none of my Apple iCloud email aliases are working. Now the question: why and since when? I'd rather not know how many emails I've missed because of this. ü§Ø At least, I think, I've resolved the issue: Under <a href=\"http://icloud.com\">icloud.com</a> / Mail / Settings / Accounts I‚Äôve disabled the Alias addresses, filled in Fullname and Label, renabled the Account alias and now it‚Äôs working again.\n\n\n## 2023-01-25\n### Apple Mail (macOS 13.1)\n\nOf course, it would be nice if Apple Mail would also show me my emails.\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://mb.esamecar.net/uploads/2023/7fe26434ec.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Apple Mail not showing the selected mail.\" title=\"CleanShot 2023-01-25 at 09.31.34.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"596\" height=\"212\" />\n\n### Home Screen (iOS 16.2)\n\nAh, not only does the lock screen not want to show widgets all the time, the (Files.app) widget on the home screen can also be empty.\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://mb.esamecar.net/uploads/2023/a81e9280f8.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot iOS home screen with blank Files.app widget\" title=\"IMG_8231.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"139\" height=\"300\" />\n\n### App Store (iOS 16.2)\n\nWhy not give us even more sorting options for subscriptions?

It told me that I don't have Xcode CLI tools installed and asked me to do so. I already had but, yeah, anyhow, I did it via the given shell command ... A few minutes later macOS tells me that there a two updates available. \n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://mb.esamecar.net/uploads/2023/9df68b44a0.png\" alt=\"Screenshot Updates available - CLI Tools Xcode\" title=\"updates_cli_xcode.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"299\" height=\"69\" />\n\nWTF? Why two versions? And why an update anyways, I just downloaded them directly from Apple?\n\n### Shortcuts\nThe Apple Shortcuts App constantly gets out of sync between my MacBook and my iPhone. Thanks!\n\n\n### Reminders\nWhy does adding reminders via Siri work without any problems under iOS and exactly the same request via Siri under macOS leads to absolutely pointless queries and error messages (at least when set to GER)? WTF?\n",

I don't feel that you can really influence the story. I'm not 100% sure if I would buy the game again. I had a quick look at [EYELAND](https://ronlent.itch.io/eyeland). However, it doesn't support savegames and so far I haven't felt like trying to tackle it in one go.\n- üéß Podcasts: Despite the ones I regularly listen to ([ATP](https://atp.fm), [The Talk Show](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/), [Automators](https://www.relay.fm/automators), [Connected](https://www.relay.fm/connected), [Techmeme Ride Home](https://www.ridehome.info/show/techmeme-ride-home/)) and due to [my](https://esamecar.net) recent interest in [micro.blog](https://micro.blog) and [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol), I stumbled upon [Hemispheric Views](https://hemisphericviews.com) by [Andrew Canion](https://micro.blog/canion/), [Jason Burk](https://micro.blog/burk), and [Martin Feld](https://micro.blog/martinfeld) as well as [Core Intuition](https://coreint.org) by [Manton Reece](https://micro.blog/manton) and [Daniel Jalkut](https://mastodon.social/@danielpunkass). \n- üìî I've written a follow up post to my [short list of non-work related macOS apps I really like](https://esamecar.net/2023/01/12/a-short-list.html): [Even more macOS apps I enjoy using](https://esamecar.net/2023/01/14/even-more-macos.html) üòé\n- üçø I've watched [Avatar: The Way of Water](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/76600-avatar-the-way-of-water) in the cinema with my family. Bombastic, sure, but - as expected - completely irrelevant and above all predictable plot. Still, I didn't regret going to the cinema again.\n- üì∫ Together with my wife I finished watching the third season of [For All Mankind](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/87917-for-all-mankind/season/3). I think I liked it better than the second and I'm looking forward to the fourth.\n- ü§ì Because of [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol) , I tried to understand [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat). It's been a long time since I was on it. It felt like back in the [Amiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga) days. I've installed [irssi](https://irssi.org/) via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), was able to connect, but failed with its operation. I'll have to look at it again some other time. Even though I am not a fan of, I understand very well why [Discord](https://discord.com) etc. have become famous ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n- üç© I've 3Dprinted some small things, primarily for household or work purposes, such as an [iPad Stand](https://www.printables.com/de/model/96617-ipad-stand), to use it as a second monitor at work and a [tea bag drainer](https://www.printables.com/de/model/295408-tea-bag-drainer-v2/files). And of course things for my AnkerMake M5 itself, like [Spare Parts Box](https://www.printables.com/de/model/304873-ankermake-m5-spare-parts-box/files) and [Accessory Bins](https://www.printables.com/model/345230-accessory-bins-for-ankermake-m5). (I was already afraid that this is another hobby that is only concerned with itself. In other words, you do things with it that you only do because you now have this thing that does things ... You understand me.)\n- ü§Ø For me, I still haven't been able to conclusively determine on which platform I want to follow whom and where I want to post something and how. The interoperability of the fedivers (micro.blog <-> mastodon together with RSS etc.) is ingenious, but it also leads to a lot of friction and redundancy at least for me. I definitely need to get better at this. In all the experimenting I've been doing over the last few days, I've often had the problem of finding the exact URL of an RSS feed. To achive this via Reeder or similar was too cumbersome  for me and the times when the browser I use simply displayed the feeds prominently are also long gone. I have therefore created an iOS/macOS [shortcuts](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/fcaa7a4964ff4c078a6a13047a59fdfe). I'm not good at it, but it does the job I hope.\n- üë®‚Äçüíª Oh, I almost forgot. The battery on my private Intel MacBook Pro was dead. I had it replaced. It cost me ‚Ç¨ 229 - not exactly cheap. But the whole thing, including sending it in (to the Czech Republic, repair and return) took less than three days üëè. However, I got a new top case with a new keyboard etc., which probably wasn't a bad idea for that model. Since it had already been in use for several years, I decided to completely rebuild it. I would have preferred to save myself the experience. So many little macOS (iCloud) bugs in the process really annoyed me and the new system settings are hell.\n\nüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n",

(The second one is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1Password<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but if I would start from scratch I would try to use the new build in password manager of macOS / iOS.) Many use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Textexpander<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but I feel more comfortable without a subscription model.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.raycast.com\">Raycast</a>: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Raycast is a blazingly fast, totally extendable launcher. It lets you complete tasks, calculate, share common links, and much more.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Before I discovered Raycast, I&rsquo;ve used Launchbar for over 15 years. It was one of these apps I would have taken with me to an lonely island. Other apps like <a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com\">Alfred</a> did not stick with me. I still like <a href=\"https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html\">Launchbar</a> a lot but enjoy the I am currently enjoying the immense expandability and dynamic development of Raycast. Right now Raycast made even my beloved window manager <a href=\"https://manytricks.com/moom/\">Moom</a> obsolete.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.craft.do\">Craft</a>: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Create documents, make impact.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I really enjoyed using Craft for some time. But actually I think, I should not use another note silo and try to achieve what I want with Apple Notes. Nevertheless, the app is very comprehensive, cross platform and easy to begin with. If you have a <a href=\"https://setapp.com/de/apps/craft\">Setapp</a> subscription, you should definitely check it out. (At this point, of course, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Obsidian<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Notion<!-- raw HTML omitted --> must also be mentioned, but neither of which I use in a private context so far.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://anybox.app\">Anybox</a>: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Manage bookmarks like a pro. A perfect replacement for your browser‚Äôs bookmark manager.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I have never been able to make friends with Safari&rsquo;s bookmark management and used to use various services, including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)\">del.icio.us</a>. Then I migrated to <a href=\"\">pinboard.in</a>, and in the meantime I only used it sporadically. <a href=\"https://get-pins.app\">Pins</a>, a very good iOS / macOS pinboard client by <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@anhdo\">Anh Do</a>, motivated me again to use pinboard more extensively. But recently my use declined rapidly again - I don&rsquo;t know exactly why. I didn&rsquo;t like well-known alternatives like <a href=\"https://raindrop.io\">raindrop.io</a> and then Anybox came along. It&rsquo;s available for macOS and iOS and more or less saves everthing but I use it solely as a bookmark manager. I&rsquo;m actually very happy with it, although I&rsquo;m curious to see whether the developer of pins can motivate me to switch again with his new app <a href=\"https://indieapps.space/@interlink\">Interlink</a>. (I hardly know why I save my bookmarks in the first place. Most of the time I look them up again using a search engine anyway.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleanshot.com\">CleanShot X</a>: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Capture your Mac‚Äôs screen like a pro.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Before I stumbled across CleanShot X, I used the native screenshot function of macOS, which is also quite extensive. In addition I used <a href=\"https://owlocr.com\">OwlOCR</a>. A utility that allows you to capture areas of the screen and then copy the text contained therein directly to the clipboard. (<a href=\"https://textsniper.app/de\">Textsniper</a> is also often recommended, but I liked the pricing and the support of OwlOCR much better. BTW Textsniper is on <a href=\"https://setapp.com/\">Setapp</a>.) I use this function daily and frequently. I would not want to do without it any more. In the meantime, on the latest version of macOS it is possible to extract text with board tools, at least in photos and I think also in other apps, but I have become so used to cmd+shift+2 (my assigned shortcut) that I no longer want to do without it. What does all this have to do with CleanShot? This function is also implemented and so much more.

I still like [Launchbar](https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html) a lot but enjoy the I am currently enjoying the immense expandability and dynamic development of Raycast. Right now Raycast made even my beloved window manager [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/) obsolete.  \n\n- [Craft](https://www.craft.do): <em>\"Create documents, make impact.\"</em> I really enjoyed using Craft for some time. But actually I think, I should not use another note silo and try to achieve what I want with Apple Notes. Nevertheless, the app is very comprehensive, cross platform and easy to begin with. If you have a [Setapp](https://setapp.com/de/apps/craft) subscription, you should definitely check it out. (At this point, of course, <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a> and <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/\">Notion</a> must also be mentioned, but neither of which I use in a private context so far.)\n\n- [Anybox](https://anybox.app): <em>\"Manage bookmarks like a pro. A perfect replacement for your browser‚Äôs bookmark manager.\"</em> I have never been able to make friends with Safari's bookmark management and used to use various services, including [del.icio.us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)). Then I migrated to [pinboard.in](), and in the meantime I only used it sporadically. [Pins](https://get-pins.app), a very good iOS / macOS pinboard client by [Anh Do](https://mastodon.social/@anhdo), motivated me again to use pinboard more extensively. But recently my use declined rapidly again - I don't know exactly why. I didn't like well-known alternatives like [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) and then Anybox came along. It's available for macOS and iOS and more or less saves everthing but I use it solely as a bookmark manager. I'm actually very happy with it, although I'm curious to see whether the developer of pins can motivate me to switch again with his new app [Interlink](https://indieapps.space/@interlink). (I hardly know why I save my bookmarks in the first place. Most of the time I look them up again using a search engine anyway.)\n\n- [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com): <em>\"Capture your Mac‚Äôs screen like a pro.\"</em> Before I stumbled across CleanShot X, I used the native screenshot function of macOS, which is also quite extensive. In addition I used [OwlOCR](https://owlocr.com). A utility that allows you to capture areas of the screen and then copy the text contained therein directly to the clipboard. ([Textsniper](https://textsniper.app/de) is also often recommended, but I liked the pricing and the support of OwlOCR much better. BTW Textsniper is on [Setapp](https://setapp.com/).) I use this function daily and frequently. I would not want to do without it any more. In the meantime, on the latest version of macOS it is possible to extract text with board tools, at least in photos and I think also in other apps, but I have become so used to cmd+shift+2 (my assigned shortcut) that I no longer want to do without it. What does all this have to do with CleanShot? This function is also implemented and so much more. Also available via [Setapp](https://setapp.com/).\n\n- [Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/): <em>\"Mind-blowing emoji on your Mac.\"</em> I really enjoy using this emoji picker. Tried using the one from Recast but went back to Rocket.\n\n- [Quitall](https://amicoapps.com/app/quitall/): <em>\"Before you Force Quit, QuitAll. A fresh start without a restart.\"</em> If it wasn't included in my [Setapp](https://setapp.com/) subscription I probably would not have bought it. I know it's a bad habit under macOS to quit apps but sometimes I have so many of them open, that I prefer a fresh start. That's were Quintal comes into play.\n\n- [Hookmark](https://hookproductivity.com): <em>\"Search Less. Focus more.\"</em> If you haven't heart of Hookmark yet, go and check it out. It's really awesome and I wish something like this was build directly into macOS. You can more or less interlink everything. Also available via [Setapp](https://setapp.com/).\n\n- And of course there are some productivity apps I mainly use for work <a href=\"https://kapeli.com/dash\">Dash</a>, <a href=\"https://www.devontechnologies.com/\">DevonThink</a>, <a href=\"https://stclairsoft.com/DefaultFolderX/\">Default Folder X</a>, <a href=\"https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/\">Keyboard Maestro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.noodlesoft.com/\">Hazel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.econtechnologies.com/chronosync/overview.html\">ChronoSync</a>. Maybe I'll write a little more about them later.\n\n- Oh, I would have forgotten about [CCC](https://bombich.com/de): <em>\"CCC does everything you wish Time Machine did (and more!)\"</em> Buy it, use it! (Or [SuperDuper!](https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html) I don't care üòé)\n\n<strong>Update</strong>: <a href=\"https://mb.esamecar.net/2023/01/14/even-more-macos.html\">even more apps ...</a>\n\n",

I&rsquo;m not sure yet if this will become something more regular, but I wanted to start putting something online more often anyway - more on that below.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve had the last two weeks off. The weather was bad, I had a cold ü§ß and therefore a lot of cycling wasn&rsquo;t an option either (at least that&rsquo;s what I told myself). So, I used the time to hang out at the computer a little more than usally. There was a lot of exciting things to discover there.\nSomehow Elon started this with the downfall of twitter, which he initiated. I had only been there reading for years anyway, and then after the takeover I decided to download my data, delete the clients on my end devices and no longer use the account.</p>\n<p>As an alternative, I was of course interested in Mastodon and clicked an account on the standard instance <a href=\"https://mastodon.social\">mastodon.social</a>. Thanks to tools like <a href=\"https://www.movetodon.org\">movetodon</a> and <a href=\"https://glitch.com/~fedifinder\">fedifinder</a> my timeline has also filled up pretty quickly, and I actually &ldquo;met&rdquo; pretty quickly some real people with whom you could exchange ideas in a friendly manner. All in all a very positive experience.</p>\n<p>One great thing about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse\">fediverse </a> is the extreme dynamics of the tools and clients that are currently being built around it. It feels like back in the early days of Twitter where, for example, a single programmer, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loren_Brichter\">Loren Brichter</a>, with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweetie\">Tweetie</a> could turn the whole twitter landscape upside down. (BTW he only has an <a href=\"https://mastodon.cloud/@loren\">inactive account</a> on Mastodon üò¢)</p>\n<p>I tried countless clients over a few days. Among others (unsorted)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ice Cubes for Mastodon (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->beta<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) by <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@dimillian\">@dimillian</a> (<a href=\"@icecubesapp@mastodon.cloud\">@icecubesapp</a>),</li>\n<li>Mammoth: for Mastodon (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->beta<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) by <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@JPEGuin\">@JPEGuin@mastodon.social</a>,</li>\n<li>Wolly for Mastodon (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->beta<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Matteo<!-- raw HTML omitted -->,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mastoot/id1501485410\">Mastoot</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mastodon/id1571998974\">Mastodon</a> (official app),</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/toot/id1229021451\">Toot!</a> (on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mastodon<!-- raw HTML omitted -->),</li>\n<li>Komondor (beta) by <a href=\"https://chaos.social/@343max\">@343max@chaos.social</a> <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>, and</li>\n<li>Ivory (beta; officially alpha ;-)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The official app is okay, but IMHO not great; toot! I liked the range of functions very much, but you also have to cope with the strange design somehow. Because I follow some accounts that post a lot, and since the timeline on Mastodon is not orchestrated by any algorithms, posts from other people are in danger of being lost. Thats why a good list function is very important to me personally. There, Mammoth also makes a very good impression, but in the end I was lucky and was able to test <a href=\"https://tapbots.social/@ivory\">Ivory</a> via Testflight. The app by <a href=\"https://tapbots.social/@paul\">Paul Haddad</a> and <a href=\"https://tapbots.social/@mark\">Mark Jardine</a> has an button design that is a bit too playful for my taste, but otherwise it is extremely stable and really great at everything it does. The recently added <a href=\"https://social.lol/@esamecar/109653526172609597\">list features</a> are awesome, as they allow certain accounts to be hidden from the home view. So, atm I stick to Ivory and am looking forward to even better builds.</p>\n<p>Then, sometime last week, I came across a <a href=\"https://social.lol/@otaviocc/109607448264194924\">post</a> from <a href=\"https://social.lol/@otaviocc\">@otaviocc@social.lol</a> on <a href=\"https://home.omg.lol\">omg.lol</a>. And then, coincidentally, I signed up for the service with thousands of other people (<a href=\"https://omglol.news/2023/01/07/wildest-36-hours-ever\">who must have read a post on Hacker News</a> and not otaviocc&rsquo;s post üòé).\nOn omg.lol you ultimately get a &ldquo;funny&rdquo; address on the web that contains a wide variety of small services. A single page website (to use as a <a href=\"https://esamecar.omg.lol\">business card</a>), a <a href=\"http://esamecar.status.lol\">statuslog</a>, an omg.lol-email address (forwarder), different DNS services, pastebin, PURL service, a <a href=\"http://esamecar.weblog.lol\">weblog</a> (beta), etc. And while I was at it anyways, I also have my <a href=\"https://social.lol/@esamecar\">Mastodon</a> account moved from mastodon.social to <a href=\"https://social.lol\">social.lol</a>. Luckily that went really smoothly. It was a lot of fun getting involved, configuring everything and thinking about what it&rsquo;s even good for ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, I continued to work with the <a href=\"https://www.ankermake.com/eu-en\">AnkerMake M5</a>, which also arrived after a very long wait at the beginning of December. All in all I&rsquo;m very happy with the 3D printer, but still don&rsquo;t really know what got into me back in early 2022 when I backed it on Kickstarter. But that is definitely going too far at this point and maybe I&rsquo;ll go into more detail elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Well, micro.blog is kind of a universe in itself too. In addition to choosing a <a href=\"https://social.lol/@muhh/109652832580041607\">theme</a>, there is of course the client question. I got some for iOS (the official <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1253201335\">app</a>, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1437753701\">Gluon for Micro.blog</a> and MacOS (<a href=\"https://redsweater.com/marsedit\">MarsEdit 5</a>, which I use via <a href=\"https://setapp.com\">Setapp</a>) looked at various editors (<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ia-writer/id775737172\">iA Writer</a>, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/drafts/id1236254471\">Drafts</a> and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/runestone-text-editor/id1548193893\">Runestone</a>. In addition, there are useful tools as <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696\">Mimi Uploader</a> (iOS) to upload images and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1592173492\">Epilogue for Micro.blog</a> to track books, but I&rsquo;m just starting out here, there are just too many apps and I have to see which ones &ldquo;click&rdquo; for me.</p>\n<p>There are of course all sorts of little helpers for publishing interesting links and posts on Mastodon or blog entries. Among others <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/linky-for-twitter-and-mastodon/id438090426\">Linky</a> and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/re-toot/id1661697436\">Re: Toot</a> by <a href=\"https://social.lol/@simonbs@mastodon.social\">Simon B. St√∏vring</a> (who, by the way, is also responsible for Runestone) I would like to mention at this point.</p>\n<p>As if all that wasn&rsquo;t enough, at the beginning of last week, after a 1.5 year wait, I received my long-awaited <a href=\"https://play.date\">playdate</a> game console. (In the meantime I had actually already forgotten that I had even ordered it and I was all the happier that it suddenly arrived.) It&rsquo;s a lot of fun to deal with the little yellow box and I wanted to jot down some impressions I got. I rented a domain with Wordpress installed last year already and tried a few things with <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">micro.blog</a> but didn&rsquo;t really publish anything on either platform. This year I wanted to change that and thus started with a <a href=\"https://esamecar.de/2023/01/07/playdate.html\">post about the playdate</a>.</p>\n<p>All in all, it was an exciting time in terms of IT. Now all of a sudden I somehow have <a href=\"https://esamecar.de/2023/01/07/hello-world.html\">three blogs</a> and will soon have to concentrate on one of them and see when everyday work starts again tomorrow, whether I still have the time and, above all, the desire to continue writing down my thoughts, or these escapades were again one of my &ldquo;manic&rdquo; excursions into something new and I would lose interest again the day after tomorrow - which would be a pity.</p>\n<p>So, maybe cu next week üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>\n<p>PS: initally, I wanted to talk a little bit about the music and podcasts I&rsquo;ve listened to, too but this post is already way too long.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>Update 22.01.2023: It <!-- raw HTML omitted -->seems like<!-- raw HTML omitted --> he is not actively developing it right now.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n",

I liked the range of functions very much, but you also have to cope with the strange design somehow. Because I follow some accounts that post a lot, and since the timeline on Mastodon is not orchestrated by any algorithms, posts from other people are in danger of being lost.

So, atm I stick to Ivory and am looking forward to even better builds.\n\nThen, sometime last week, I came across a [post](https://social.lol/@otaviocc/109607448264194924) from [@otaviocc@social.lol](https://social.lol/@otaviocc) on [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol). And then, coincidentally, I signed up for the service with thousands of other people ([who must have read a post on Hacker News](https://omglol.news/2023/01/07/wildest-36-hours-ever) and not otaviocc's post üòé). \nOn omg.lol you ultimately get a \"funny\" address on the web that contains a wide variety of small services. A single page website (to use as a [business card](https://esamecar.omg.lol)), a [statuslog](http://esamecar.status.lol), an omg.lol-email address (forwarder), different DNS services, pastebin, PURL service, a [weblog](http://esamecar.weblog.lol) (beta), etc. And while I was at it anyways, I also have my [Mastodon](https://social.lol/@esamecar) account moved from mastodon.social to [social.lol](https://social.lol). Luckily that went really smoothly. It was a lot of fun getting involved, configuring everything and thinking about what it's even good for ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.\n\nIn the meantime, I continued to work with the [AnkerMake M5](https://www.ankermake.com/eu-en), which also arrived after a very long wait at the beginning of December. All in all I'm very happy with the 3D printer, but still don't really know what got into me back in early 2022 when I backed it on Kickstarter. But that is definitely going too far at this point and maybe I'll go into more detail elsewhere.\n\nWell, micro.blog is kind of a universe in itself too. In addition to choosing a [theme](https://social.lol/@muhh/109652832580041607), there is of course the client question. I got some for iOS (the official [app](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1253201335), [Gluon for Micro.blog](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1437753701) and MacOS ([MarsEdit 5](https://redsweater.com/marsedit), which I use via [Setapp](https://setapp.com)) looked at various editors ([iA Writer](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ia-writer/id775737172), [Drafts](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/drafts/id1236254471) and [Runestone](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/runestone-text-editor/id1548193893). In addition, there are useful tools as [Mimi Uploader](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696) (iOS) to upload images and [Epilogue for Micro.blog](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1592173492) to track books, but I'm just starting out here, there are just too many apps and I have to see which ones \"click\" for me.\n\nThere are of course all sorts of little helpers for publishing interesting links and posts on Mastodon or blog entries. Among others [Linky](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/linky-for-twitter-and-mastodon/id438090426) and [Re: Toot](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/re-toot/id1661697436) by [Simon B. St√∏vring](https://social.lol/@simonbs@mastodon.social) (who, by the way, is also responsible for Runestone) I would like to mention at this point.\n\nAs if all that wasn't enough, at the beginning of last week, after a 1.5 year wait, I received my long-awaited [playdate](https://play.date) game console. (In the meantime I had actually already forgotten that I had even ordered it and I was all the happier that it suddenly arrived.) It's a lot of fun to deal with the little yellow box and I wanted to jot down some impressions I got. I rented a domain with Wordpress installed last year already and tried a few things with [micro.blog](https://micro.blog) but didn't really publish anything on either platform. This year I wanted to change that and thus started with a [post about the playdate](https://esamecar.de/2023/01/07/playdate.html).\n\nAll in all, it was an exciting time in terms of IT. Now all of a sudden I somehow have [three blogs](https://esamecar.de/2023/01/07/hello-world.html) and will soon have to concentrate on one of them and see when everyday work starts again tomorrow, whether I still have the time and, above all, the desire to continue writing down my thoughts, or these escapades were again one of my \"manic\" excursions into something new and I would lose interest again the day after tomorrow - which would be a pity.\n\nSo, maybe cu next week üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nPS: initally, I wanted to talk a little bit about the music and podcasts I've listened to, too but this post is already way too long.\n\n[^1]: Update 22.01.2023: It <a href=\"https://chaos.social/@343max/109721280698325235\">seems like</a> he is not actively developing it right now.\n\n",

Every animation, every sound somehow expresses the joy and dedication that Cable Sasser and his team at <a href=\"https://panic.com/\">Panic</a> evidently put into the development of this ‚Äì while <a href=\"https://shop.play.date/\">rather expensive</a> piece of hardware.</p>\n<p>I really like the first two games of <a href=\"https://play.date/games/\">Series 1</a> so far and they couldn‚Äôt be more different. <a href=\"https://play.date/games/whitewater-wipeout/\">Whitewater Wipeout</a> is quite a challenging game of skill in the spirit of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/o_2S5CSc97M \">California Games</a>, which I played with friends for hours on the C64 and immediately brought back fond memories. The game makes very good use of the crank. At first I was happy about 200 points, meanwhile it‚Äôs a few thousand and my sons, who grew up with graphically bombastic touchscreen games on iPad and Co. or complex titles on the PS4, also liked it straight away and now fill the high score. However, how you can achieve several million points in this game will probably always remain a mystery to me.</p>\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.racemat.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/CleanShot-2023-01-07-at-12.14.32.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Whitewater Wipeout Highscore on playdate\" border= \"0\" width=\"200\" />\n<p><a href=\"https://play.date/games/casual-birder/\">Casual Birder</a> is ‚Äûa snap-‚Äöem-all adventure set in beautiful seaside Bird Town‚Äú and also entertaining. However, I haven‚Äôt really progressed very far here.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm definitely looking forward to the next 20 games that are included in the purchase price, which also puts it into perspective, and I‚Äôm excited for the upcoming <a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch/TW2SHhYw0Vo?t=536\" >store</a> (aka <a href=\"https://playdate-wiki.com/wiki/Catalog\">catalog</a>).</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, you can load your own games and applications onto the device via USB or a website (called <a href=\"https://play.date/account/sideload/\">sideload</a>). A probably almost complete overview of all projects can be found on the <a href=\"https://playdate-wiki.com/wiki/Main_Page\">playdate community wiki</a>. The games are often offered on <a href=\"https://itch.io/games/tag-playdate\">itch.io</a> and usually cost somewhere between $1 and $10.</p>\n<p>So far I‚Äôve been into <a href=\"https://rngpartygames.itch.io/bloom\">Bloom</a>, ‚Äûa real-time narrative-driven social sim about starting up a flower shop‚Äú and <a href =\"https://possiblyaxolotl.itch.io/rocketbytes\">Rocket Bytes</a>, ‚Äûa 1-bit precision rocket flying reverse platformer‚Äú. The former is just plain nice, the latter hard as hell. Other games I would like to check out are <a href=\"https://ronlent.itch.io/eyeland\">EYELAND</a>, <a href=\"https://gingerbeardman.itch.io /daily-driver\">Daily Driver (Tech Demo)</a> and <a href=\"https://frankbsadgames.itch.io/a-balanced-brew\">A Balanced Brew</a>. And if you have a dollar left over, you can also buy <a href=\"https://kamibox.itch.io/a-joke-thats-worth-099\">A Joke Thats Worth $0.99</a> for a smile.</p>\n<p>As if that weren‚Äôt enough, Panic has an app called <a href=\"https://play.date/mirror/\">Mirror</a> that allows games to be streamed and recorded directly to a monitor. <a href=\"https://help.play.date/games/mirror/#key-uses\">Accessibility</a> has also been considered. And then of course there‚Äôs the <a href=\"https://play.date/dev/\">development environment</a>, once in professional and as if that wasn‚Äôt enough, also a comprehensive <a href=\"https ://play.date/pulp/\">web editor</a>, with which you can develop really professional games in the browser.</p>\n<p>It was also a good thing that I have been the happy owner of an <a href=\"https://www.ankermake.com/eu-en\">AnkerMake M5</a> since December 2022, so I was able to get a suitable <a href=\"https://www.printables.com/de/model/226801-magnetic-cover-for-playdate/files\">Magnetic Cover</a>, because unfortunately I didn‚Äôt have the official <a href=\" https://shop.play.date\">ordered</a> and now the shipping would be more expensive than the case itself ;-(</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://www.racemat.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8156-1.jpeg\" alt=\"3d printed magnetic cover for playdate\" title=\"IMG_8156.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"150\" /></p>\n<p>I‚Äôm excited to see how the little yellow part will continue, I‚Äôm looking forward to regular game updates for the next eleven weeks and at the same time I‚Äôll be listening to the official <a href=\"https://podcast.play.date/\">podcast</a>. Long story short: for me personally a really compelling overall package.</p>\n",
