			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been using Apple products for almost 18 years now. I adore their hardware and used to be a big fan of their software ecosystem. However, the software quality has plummeted lately, to the point where I&rsquo;ve decided not to buy any new Apple products for the time being.</p>
<p><strong>Because it just does not work</strong> (reliably).</p>
<p>I will continue using the devices I already have, and I do have quite a few. But I will actively resist the urge to acquire new flashy products from Cupertino until I feel that Apple gets its act together again.</p>
<p>Here are just a few random examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>My new Airpods Pro (2nd Gen) just do not appear in Find My.</li>
<li>The for us essential Screen Time feature often doesn&rsquo;t work at all on my youngest son&rsquo;s iPhone.</li>
<li>Both of my Macs often lose all their entries in System Settings / Accessibility, rendering a bunch of apps useless until I manually add them back in.</li>
<li>System Settings itself are a nightmare.</li>
<li>Messages ALWAYS informs me that my son has enabled &ldquo;do not disturb mode,&rdquo; preventing him from receiving incoming messages. Of course, that is not true at all.</li>
<li>Screen Time requests from my son show up in a group chat with him and my wife. I have to delete all messages daily in that chat because the Screen Time messages make the thread unresponsive. It even crashes on macOS. So, the chat becomes unusable for communication. We have to use another app - WTF?</li>
<li>Preview under macOS loses text notes for annotations I&rsquo;ve made after saving a PDF. This is a complete showstopper for the entire app. Data loss should be unacceptable.</li>
<li>My Home Pod mini in the kitchen often forgets timers. This really makes me happy during cooking.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t even get me started on the general reliability of Siri.</li>
<li>Recently, I discovered that many files do not appear in Spotlight search. It&rsquo;s frustrating when I know a file is there, but it simply cannot be found. This is almost as bad as data loss.</li>
<li>And then there all those little bugs I just ignore on a daily basis. There are definitely enough to start a &ldquo;a bug a day&rdquo; series &hellip;</li>
</ol>

			 <p>I thought before I implement my own blogroll on my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->omg.lol<!-- raw HTML omitted --> page, I might as well first compile a list of blogrolls created by people whose blogs I like to follow. So, a blogroll for blogrolls: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blogroll.lol<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t yet been to many different countries. That&rsquo;s mainly because my wife and I decided two decades ago to avoid cars and planes for traveling.

</ul>
</li>
<li>üéôÔ∏è This was my <strong>first episode of <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Launched/109744688589490094">Launched</a></strong>. It was a rather intimate podcast. And both the developers of the <a href="https://darknoise.app">Darknoise</a> app and <a href="https://sofahq.com">Sofa</a> seem to be very nice people. After what they said about <strong>software subscriptions</strong>, I&rsquo;m afraid that sooner or later all apps will have to switch to the subscription model. I personally don&rsquo;t like that, but if there&rsquo;s no other way for indie developers, you probably have to think about what you&rsquo;re willing to spend per year and then keep an eye on your subscriptions, e.g. with <a href="https://bobbyapp.co">Bobby</a>, and limit them accordingly.</li>
<li>üõãÔ∏è Speaking of <a href="https://sofahq.com">Sofa</a>. I really like the app, but I think I&rsquo;ll try to stay away from software and services where it&rsquo;s not possible to get your data out again with open standards, an API or at least an RSS feed.</li>
<li>ü´∞ Speaking of subscriptions, after all this <a href="https://mas.to/@dcrainmaker/109761992004211636">back and forth</a>, I <strong>cancelled my Strava subscription</strong>. I&rsquo;ll see if I can enjoy cycling without all their pro features.</li>
<li>üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Speaking of (I know, I know &hellip;) cycling, once again I have felt annoyed, no, <strong>threatened by SUV</strong> drivers. I really don&rsquo;t know where all this is going. Fittingly, the <a href="https://indieweb.social/@magalhini/109739198359436268">post</a> about the size of cars.</li>
<li>üêò I had a look at <strong><a href="https://social.shadowfacts.net/objects/25db7fa3-31e5-46aa-a534-643de7617f8e">Tusker</a></strong>, a new iOS Mastodon client. It&rsquo;s still fun to see all these many ideas for Mastodon clients. There hasn&rsquo;t been so much dynamism in the scene for a long time. Even though <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ice-cubes-for-mastodon/id6444915884">IceCube</a> gets a lot of praise, I keep coming back to <a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/">Ivory</a>, which was finally released in the App Store this week. You can only have missed it, though, if you&rsquo;ve been living under a rock. Even though I find the development speed of IceCube absolutely remarkable and the app is certainly one of the most impressive in terms of features, I am still bothered by the many small bugs and especially the bad scrolling performance. (I think SwiftUI might be the one to blame here.) Ivory, on the other hand, is really fast and performant. The great thing is that you can change at any time.</li>
<li>üïπÔ∏è I&rsquo;ve played the two new <strong>playdate games</strong> that were released for me this week: <a href="https://play.date/games/flipper-lifter/">Flipper Lifter</a> and <a href="https://play.date/games/echoic-memory/">Echoic Memory</a>. I am really bad at audio and don&rsquo;t know if I enjoy Echoic Memory and I haven&rsquo;t found any access to Flipper Lifter yet. In general, with some playdate games, I sometimes feel like I don&rsquo;t really understand the mechanics of the game, and just do anything that will somehow get me to the goal. I sometimes wish the games would introduce you a little more and not leave you completely out in the cold.</li>
<li>üïπÔ∏è In the end, everything was overshadowed by the fact that my <strong>playdate</strong> probably <strong>has</strong> a <strong>faulty battery</strong>. I have, surprisingly unexpectedly, received an answer from <a href="https://social.panic.com/@cabel/109757052741921514">Cabel</a>, but unfortunately not yet from support. They seem to be quite overwhelmed by support requests right now.</li>
<li>üì± On <strong>iOS</strong>, I looked at <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1489443070">Countdown to Anything!</a> but I think I&rsquo;ll stick with <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/countdowns-termine-verfolgen/id917514700">Countdowns</a>.</li>
<li>üì± This <a href="https://social.lol/@inkeduprunner/109744118273037005">screenshot</a> of Jason&rsquo;s homescreen inspired me to tinker a little bit with <a href="https://social.lol/@inkeduprunner/109744118273037005">Widgy</a>. I also bought <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/opener-open-links-in-apps/id989565871">Opener</a>, don&rsquo;t know why üòá</li>
<li>üíª On the <strong>Mac</strong>, I&rsquo;ve been looking at the new <a href="https://thebrowser.company">Arc</a> browser, which is kind of hyped right now. I really don&rsquo;t know why though. I have a bit of a suspicion that it might just be the invite system. To me, the browser seems extremely sluggish. My password management and Apple Pay don&rsquo;t work, which is probably not the browser&rsquo;s fault. It&rsquo;s too early to judge, but so far I always go back to Safari after a short time.</li>
<li>üíª It came to my mind, that you can use Markdown links of <a href="https://mastodon.cloud/@cogsciapps/109758770719895321">hooked</a> items together with <a href="https://sindresorhus.com/one-thing">One Thing</a>, an App that I really enjoy. It gives you one click menu bar item to the one file you are just working on.</li>
<li>üíª I had a look at <a href="https://hidock.app/">HiDock, for Mac</a> and <a href="https://thelasso.app/">Lasso - Window Manager for macOS</a>.</li>
<li>üíª Thanks to <a href="https://social.lol/@mken/109750124058233654">Matthew</a> I became aware of <a href="https://menubarx.app">Menubar X</a> (<a href="https://setapp.com/de/apps/menubarx">Setapp</a>). This works pretty well together with <a href="https://www.deepl.com/translator">DeepL</a> / <a href="https://www.deepl.com/write">DeepL Write</a> and <a href="https://elk.zone/">elk.zone</a>.</li>
<li>‚úÖ I&rsquo;ve moved all my todo item for work from <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a> to Apple&rsquo;s Reminders app. I want to see if I can separate them enough thanks to smart lists and tags. The only thing I miss so far is the ability to filter by focus modes, like it is possible with Calendars, etc. Only Apple knows why this is not possible yet, I guess.</li>
<li>‚ù§Ô∏è Thanks to <a href="https://social.lol/@faisal/109750741237166481">Faisal Misle</a>, I now also know that you can publish to the omg.lol weblog via <a href="https://github.com/neatnik/weblog.lol">github</a>. I have no idea about all these things, but thanks to the many great tutorials, even I managed to do it. Speaking of <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> and how clueless I am about all this internet stuff, I managed to change my <a href="https://esamecar.status.lol">status.log</a> via the <a href="https://api.omg.lol/">API</a>, again thanks to the awesome docs. I control this with a Shortcuts shortcut and can trigger it from my <a href="https://www.elgato.com/">Stream Deck</a> and <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a>. You can do so many funny things with this ü•∞</li>

			 <p>Streak, this is the third time this year I&rsquo;ve managed to write down what I&rsquo;ve done during the week.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in what it was like before, you can read about the <a href="https://esamecar.net/2023/01/08/what-i-have.html">first</a> and <a href="https://esamecar.net/2023/01/15/what-i-have.html">second</a> week.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have been very busy at work this week. So there was less to discover. I did a lot of walking with the dog (~ 50 km from Monday to Saturday so far), so at least I had enough time to listen to podcasts:
<ul>
<li>üéôÔ∏è I really enjoyed <a href="https://overcast.fm/+6u827rjC0">Really Specific Stories: John Siracusa</a>. A podcast I did not know about before. This was a very intimate conversation and I discovered so much of myself in what was told. Unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t even begin to speak with such reflection and eloquence. There&rsquo;s definitely a reason I&rsquo;m not a podcaster, and an absolutely insignificant little fish otherwise. What I also found very interesting was <a href="https://overcast.fm/+B7ND0zcCY">The Talk Show: ‚ÄòSlow-Moving Hurricane‚Äô, With Craig Hockenberry</a>. I only knew Craig Hockenberry from <a href="https://mastodon.social/@chockenberry">his posts and profile picture</a>. I was very surprised to listen to such a level-headed, reflective person. It&rsquo;s always exciting what impressions you get about people just by reading about them or listening to them. The episode <a href="https://overcast.fm/+6u81QBHHQ">Really Specific Stories: Jason Burk</a> fit in very well with this. I&rsquo;m already looking forward to the others.</li>
<li>üéôÔ∏è Parallel to the release of the two new games <a href="https://play.date/games/lost-your-marbles/">Lost Your Marbles</a> and <a href="https://play.date/games/pickpackpup/">Pick Pack Pup</a> in Series 1 for <a href="https://esamecar.net/2023/01/07/playdate.html">my playdate</a> I listened to the respective podcast episodes: <a href="https://overcast.fm/+5Ddo1eC7M">Playdate Podcast: Pick Pack Pup</a> and <a href="https://overcast.fm/+5DdrMprw0">Playdate Podcast: Lost Your Marbles</a>.</li>
<li>üéôÔ∏è Additionally I&rsquo;ve listened to <a href="https://overcast.fm/+Fcm_P4vGY">Upgrade: 441: Qi2: Qi Harder</a>, <a href="https://overcast.fm/+I5CmMcSjU">AppStories: Read-Later Apps</a>, <a href="https://overcast.fm/+Fcm-buxIs">Upgrade: 442: Zombie Arms and Toaster Fridge</a>, <a href="https://overcast.fm/+FgnYjcuX0">Under the Radar: 260: Subscription School</a>, and <a href="https://overcast.fm/+FXx6P7vZI">Connected: 433: The Best Alarm is the Alarm</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For these posts, I was looking for a way to log the podcast episodes I was listening to, but couldn&rsquo;t find a way to look them up in <a href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a>. So I wrote a Shortcuts script that logs the currently playing episode to a Drafts document after 30 seconds.</li>
<li>ü•ò Speaking of the Shortcuts app. I love <a href="https://mela.recipes">Mela</a> and in my family we use <a href="https://www.ponlist.de">Pon</a> for shopping lists. Unfortunately, there is no way to export shopping lists directly from Mela to Pon. And it is not possible to import the corresponding Reminders list into Pon. So I put together a little <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/9c1fa9b21f574dfd81d65e8ae55e8305">shortcut</a> that somehow does the job.</li>
<li>‚ù§Ô∏è I was playing around with my <a href="https://now.esamecar.net">omg/now</a> page.</li>
<li>üíª I bought <a href="https://www.houdah.com/photosWorkbench/">Photos Workbench</a>. I think I will mainly use it to compare and select pictures. I really miss a corresponding function in the Photos app. I have looked a lot for alternatives and had even subscribed to Lightroom in the meantime. But that&rsquo;s a complete overkill and I don&rsquo;t want to have any more software from that company. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m happy that an app has now been released that will hopefully take care of that.</li>
<li>üïπÔ∏è Played <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/pick-pack-pup/3030-82889/">Pick Pack Pup (2022)</a> and the first ten levels of <a href="https://social.lol/@esamecar/109727415412705797">Gravity Express</a>. The former is fine but I did not fell in love so far. The latter ist very similar to <a href="https://possiblyaxolotl.itch.io/rocketbytes">Rocket Bytes</a> but Gravity Express has checkpoints, tasks, fuel, etc. I seems not that hardcore as the other. I really like what I&rsquo;ve seen so far.</li>
<li>üóºStumbled across <a href="https://lantern.rknight.me">Lantern</a>.</li>
<li>Bought <a href="https://mstdn.plus/@lapcatsoftware/109718227833446585">Homecoming for Mastodon</a>. I think this can easily be done via Shortcuts too but anyways &hellip;</li>
<li>üì∫ No TV, now movies this week üò¢</li>
<li>üßäGave the <a href="https://github.com/Dimillian/IceCubesApp">IceCubeApp</a> beta another try. Unlike many others, I&rsquo;m not warming up to the app. It has too many little bugs that make it hard for me to use it regularly. But of course, the whole <a href="https://social.lol/@esamecar/109717531311835254">App Store approval saga</a> was funny - or rather the opposite.</li>
<li>üéôÔ∏è<a href="https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper/large">MacWhisper</a>: It&rsquo;s absolutely impressive what&rsquo;s now possible.</li>
<li>üí¨ Too much <a href="https://social.lol/@esamecar">Mastodon</a> but I really like it there. And <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber">Gruber</a> even replied to me. He <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/109723774597173088">disagreed</a> and I didn&rsquo;t want to argue, but whatever!</li>

I then immediately received countless warnings from various apps (Hookmark, CleanShot X, Typinator, etc.) that they would no longer work.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>After all, this is the second time this year that I&rsquo;ve managed to <a href="https://esamecar.net/2023/01/08/what-i-have.html">write down a bit</a> what has been keeping me busy during the week. ü•≥</p>
<ul>
<li>üòî So, this was my first week at work and thus, unfortunately, again far too little time for things I really enjoy. (I&rsquo;ll have to think about my work situation in great detail at some point).</li>
<li>üïπ Playdate: After the two pre-installed games on my playdate, the first two new games included  in Episode 1 arrived for me on Monday: <a href="https://play.date/games/crankin/">Crankin&rsquo;s Time Travel Adventure </a> and <a href="https://play.date/games/boogie-loops/">Boogie Loops</a>. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m completely musically untalented, so I haven&rsquo;t looked at Boogie Loops yet, but I despair of Crankin&rsquo;s Time Travel Adventure. As a now completely inexperienced player, I fail grandiosely at this game. For me it is extremely difficult. I just got to level 20 and I was <a href="https://social.lol/@phils/109676285675288252">told</a> that there must be 50 levels. Another game on the list of games I will never play through. <a href="https://rngpartygames.itch.io/bloom">Bloom</a> meanders along. I find it a bit of a pity that in the dialogues there are really only the same statements available, each worded a little differently. I don&rsquo;t feel that you can really influence the story. I&rsquo;m not 100% sure if I would buy the game again. I had a quick look at <a href="https://ronlent.itch.io/eyeland">EYELAND</a>. However, it doesn&rsquo;t support savegames and so far I haven&rsquo;t felt like trying to tackle it in one go.</li>
<li>üéß Podcasts: Despite the ones I regularly listen to (<a href="https://atp.fm">ATP</a>, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/">The Talk Show</a>, <a href="https://www.relay.fm/automators">Automators</a>, <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected">Connected</a>, <a href="https://www.ridehome.info/show/techmeme-ride-home/">Techmeme Ride Home</a>) and due to <a href="https://esamecar.net">my</a> recent interest in <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a> and <a href="https://home.omg.lol">omg.lol</a>, I stumbled upon <a href="https://hemisphericviews.com">Hemispheric Views</a> by <a href="https://micro.blog/canion/">Andrew Canion</a>, <a href="https://micro.blog/burk">Jason Burk</a>, and <a href="https://micro.blog/martinfeld">Martin Feld</a> as well as <a href="https://coreint.org">Core Intuition</a> by <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">Manton Reece</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@danielpunkass">Daniel Jalkut</a>.</li>
<li>üìî I&rsquo;ve written a follow up post to my <a href="https://esamecar.net/2023/01/12/a-short-list.html">short list of non-work related macOS apps I really like</a>: <a href="https://esamecar.net/2023/01/14/even-more-macos.html">Even more macOS apps I enjoy using</a> üòé</li>
<li>üçø I&rsquo;ve watched <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/76600-avatar-the-way-of-water">Avatar: The Way of Water</a> in the cinema with my family. Bombastic, sure, but - as expected - completely irrelevant and above all predictable plot. Still, I didn&rsquo;t regret going to the cinema again.</li>
<li>üì∫ Together with my wife I finished watching the third season of <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/87917-for-all-mankind/season/3">For All Mankind</a>. I think I liked it better than the second and I&rsquo;m looking forward to the fourth.</li>
<li>ü§ì Because of <a href="https://home.omg.lol">omg.lol</a> , I tried to understand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a>. It&rsquo;s been a long time since I was on it. It felt like back in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga">Amiga</a> days. I&rsquo;ve installed <a href="https://irssi.org/">irssi</a> via <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, was able to connect, but failed with its operation. I&rsquo;ll have to look at it again some other time. Even though I am not a fan of, I understand very well why <a href="https://discord.com">Discord</a> etc. have become famous ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</li>
<li>üç© I&rsquo;ve 3Dprinted some small things, primarily for household or work purposes, such as an <a href="https://www.printables.com/de/model/96617-ipad-stand">iPad Stand</a>, to use it as a second monitor at work and a <a href="https://www.printables.com/de/model/295408-tea-bag-drainer-v2/files">tea bag drainer</a>. And of course things for my AnkerMake M5 itself, like <a href="https://www.printables.com/de/model/304873-ankermake-m5-spare-parts-box/files">Spare Parts Box</a> and <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/345230-accessory-bins-for-ankermake-m5">Accessory Bins</a>. (I was already afraid that this is another hobby that is only concerned with itself. In other words, you do things with it that you only do because you now have this thing that does things &hellip; You understand me.)</li>
<li>ü§Ø For me, I still haven&rsquo;t been able to conclusively determine on which platform I want to follow whom and where I want to post something and how. The interoperability of the fedivers (micro.blog &lt;-&gt; mastodon together with RSS etc.) is ingenious, but it also leads to a lot of friction and redundancy at least for me. I definitely need to get better at this. In all the experimenting I&rsquo;ve been doing over the last few days, I&rsquo;ve often had the problem of finding the exact URL of an RSS feed. To achive this via Reeder or similar was too cumbersome  for me and the times when the browser I use simply displayed the feeds prominently are also long gone. I have therefore created an iOS/macOS <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/fcaa7a4964ff4c078a6a13047a59fdfe">shortcuts</a>. I&rsquo;m not good at it, but it does the job I hope.</li>
<li>üë®‚Äçüíª Oh, I almost forgot. The battery on my private Intel MacBook Pro was dead. I had it replaced. It cost me ‚Ç¨ 229 - not exactly cheap. But the whole thing, including sending it in (to the Czech Republic, repair and return) took less than three days üëè. However, I got a new top case with a new keyboard etc., which probably wasn&rsquo;t a bad idea for that model. Since it had already been in use for several years, I decided to completely rebuild it. I would have preferred to save myself the experience. So many little macOS (iCloud) bugs in the process really annoyed me and the new system settings are hell.</li>
</ul>
<p>üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

			 <p>Sure, shortly after I&rsquo;ve published the <a href="https://esamecar.net/2023/01/12/a-short-list.html">short list of non-work related macOS apps I really like</a> it came to my mind, that I forgot the most important ones. But hey, I never claimed it was an exhaustive list üòá
So, I&rsquo;ll just continue and list randomly some more apps, I enjoy using:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mela.recipes">Mela</a>: <em>&ldquo;Mela is a simple, elegant and modern recipe manager that syncs with iCloud.&quot;</em> I recently switched from <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/paprika-recipe-manager-3/id1303222628?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink">Paprika</a>, which is also a very good recipe manager. But I do prefer the app from Silvio Rizzi (<a href="https://gloria.social/@rizzi">Mastodon/rizzi@gloria.social</a>) because of its more modern design and the build in recipe RSS feature üë®‚Äçüç≥. RSS is something Silvio knows a lot about, as he is also responsible for my RSS reader of choice:</li>
<li><a href="https://reederapp.com">Reeder</a>: <em>&ldquo;Keep control of your news reading with Reeder, RSS reader and read later client in one app, now with support for iCloud syncing.&quot;</em> Of course there is a bunch of other RSS readers üì∞. If I had to switch, I would probably go with <a href="https://netnewswire.com">NetNewsWire</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://dropoverapp.com">Dropover</a>: <em>&ldquo;Dropover is a macOS utility that makes Drag and Drop easier. Stash, gather or move draggable content without having to open side-by-side windows.&quot;</em> Before I&rsquo;ve stumbled upon Dropover I&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://eternalstorms.at/yoink/mac/">Yoink</a> for years (<a href="https://setapp.com/">Setapp</a>). I do like both apps. With the former, you don&rsquo;t always have to wander üñ±Ô∏è all the way to the edge of the screen to drop files. I kind of liked that. Yoink also has a counterpart for <a href="https://eternalstorms.at/yoink/ios/">iOS</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://soulver.app">Soulver</a>: <em>&ldquo;Soulver is a notepad calculator app for Mac. It&rsquo;s a notepad that gives instant answers to calculations in your text.&quot;</em> Soulver is also such a macOS classic. Since version 3, the Mac app is unfortunately no longer compatible with the iOS version and I have a little impression that the developer has lost a little desire ü•±. But nevertheless, it&rsquo;s a great tool. [<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update 19.01.2023<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: I have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->learned<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, that the iOS version has been discontinued but instead the Mac version is now on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Setapp<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</li>
<li><a href="https://moneymoney-app.com/">Money Money</a>: <em>&ldquo;Alle Bankkonten im Blick mit MoneyMoney.&quot;</em> Okay, Money Money is specific to the German market. But if you have a bank account there and don&rsquo;t want to deal with the web interface of your bank üè¶, Money Money is a great choice. The app only costs money once and I don&rsquo;t remember ever being asked to pay for an update. (That scares me a little bit, I have to admit).</li>
<li><a href="https://dayoneapp.com/blog/day-one-version-3-for-macos/">Day One</a>: <em>&ldquo;Day One is a journaling app for the iPhone, iPad and Mac. From once-in-a-lifetime events to everyday moments, Day One‚Äôs elegant interface makes journaling your life a simple pleasure.&quot;</em> My first entry üìî dates back to 2012, and I have ~10 k entries saved in there. I think that says it all üòÑ I do pipe a lot of stuff to Day One with the help of <a href="https://ifttt.com">ifttt</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.macbartender.com/">Bartender 4</a>: <em>&ldquo;Bartender is an award-winning app for macOS that superpowers your menu bar, giving you total control over your menu bar items, what&rsquo;s displayed, and when, with menu bar items only showing when you need them.&quot;</em> I run a lot of menu bar apps. Therefore this app (<a href="https://setapp.com/">Setapp</a>) is indispensable for me on my 13&rdquo; MacBook üíª. Speaking of menu bar apps:</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/coca/id1000808993?mt=12">Coca</a>: <em>&ldquo;Coca is a tiny app that puts an icon in your menu bar. Right-click the icon to prevent your system from automatically going to sleep, dimming the screen or starting screen savers.&quot;</em> Very handy in certain circumstances, e.g. you want that backup / download to finish over night etc. There are lots of similar apps, like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12">Amphetamine</a> or <a href="https://intelliscapesolutions.com/apps/caffeine">Caffeine</a> ‚òï.</li>
<li><a href="https://v2.airbuddy.app/">AirBuddy</a>: <em>&ldquo;Take Control of Your Wireless Devices on macOS.&quot;</em> If you own Air Pods üéß and want to switch from iPhone to Mac, have a look at this utility (<a href="https://setapp.com/">Setapp</a>). And speaking of music:</li>
<li><a href="https://www.neptunesmac.app/">NepTunes</a>: <em>&ldquo;A desktop accessory that allows you to see and control your music (Apple Music, Spotify) with customizable shortcuts, advanced Last.fm support and beautiful themes.&quot;</em> Any nice app that results in me having to open Apple&rsquo;s music üéµ app less often is a win.</li>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Here is a short list of apps I use a lot under macOS privately (so not only work related) or I have recently discovered and think I&rsquo;ll stick with them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://bunchapp.co/docs/">Bunch</a>: Bunch describes itself as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;a macOS utility that uses plain text scripts called ‚ÄúBunches‚Äù to automate context switching. It sits in your menu [&hellip;]. Bunches can open apps, specific files, web pages, and more. For the Power Users, It also allows advanced scripting, system commands, and integration via a URL handler&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s free to download, developed by <a href="https://nojack.easydns.ca/@ttscoff">Brett Terpstra</a>. I switched from <a href="https://www.apptorium.com/workspaces">Workspaces</a> by <a href="https://www.apptorium.com">Apptorium</a>, which has a much more sophisticated visual concept. I also like the app very much and is also available via <a href="https://setapp.com/">Setapp</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Typinator<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Enter words, sentences, or even entire paragraphs by typing just a few characters. Save time for the really important things in life.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> If I use a Mac without Typinator installed, I can hardly operate it. Therefore, it is one of the first programmes I add. (The second one is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1Password<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but if I would start from scratch I would try to use the new build in password manager of macOS / iOS.) Many use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Textexpander<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but I feel more comfortable without a subscription model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.raycast.com">Raycast</a>: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Raycast is a blazingly fast, totally extendable launcher. It lets you complete tasks, calculate, share common links, and much more.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Before I discovered Raycast, I&rsquo;ve used Launchbar for over 15 years. It was one of these apps I would have taken with me to an lonely island. Other apps like <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a> did not stick with me. I still like <a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html">Launchbar</a> a lot but enjoy the I am currently enjoying the immense expandability and dynamic development of Raycast. Right now Raycast made even my beloved window manager <a href="https://manytricks.com/moom/">Moom</a> obsolete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.craft.do">Craft</a>: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Create documents, make impact.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I really enjoyed using Craft for some time. But actually I think, I should not use another note silo and try to achieve what I want with Apple Notes. Nevertheless, the app is very comprehensive, cross platform and easy to begin with. If you have a <a href="https://setapp.com/de/apps/craft">Setapp</a> subscription, you should definitely check it out. (At this point, of course, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Obsidian<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Notion<!-- raw HTML omitted --> must also be mentioned, but neither of which I use in a private context so far.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://anybox.app">Anybox</a>: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Manage bookmarks like a pro. A perfect replacement for your browser‚Äôs bookmark manager.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I have never been able to make friends with Safari&rsquo;s bookmark management and used to use various services, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)">del.icio.us</a>. Then I migrated to <a href="">pinboard.in</a>, and in the meantime I only used it sporadically. <a href="https://get-pins.app">Pins</a>, a very good iOS / macOS pinboard client by <a href="https://mastodon.social/@anhdo">Anh Do</a>, motivated me again to use pinboard more extensively. But recently my use declined rapidly again - I don&rsquo;t know exactly why. I didn&rsquo;t like well-known alternatives like <a href="https://raindrop.io">raindrop.io</a> and then Anybox came along. It&rsquo;s available for macOS and iOS and more or less saves everthing but I use it solely as a bookmark manager. I&rsquo;m actually very happy with it, although I&rsquo;m curious to see whether the developer of pins can motivate me to switch again with his new app <a href="https://indieapps.space/@interlink">Interlink</a>. (I hardly know why I save my bookmarks in the first place. Most of the time I look them up again using a search engine anyway.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cleanshot.com">CleanShot X</a>: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Capture your Mac‚Äôs screen like a pro.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Before I stumbled across CleanShot X, I used the native screenshot function of macOS, which is also quite extensive. In addition I used <a href="https://owlocr.com">OwlOCR</a>. A utility that allows you to capture areas of the screen and then copy the text contained therein directly to the clipboard. (<a href="https://textsniper.app/de">Textsniper</a> is also often recommended, but I liked the pricing and the support of OwlOCR much better. BTW Textsniper is on <a href="https://setapp.com/">Setapp</a>.) I use this function daily and frequently. I would not want to do without it any more. In the meantime, on the latest version of macOS it is possible to extract text with board tools, at least in photos and I think also in other apps, but I have become so used to cmd+shift+2 (my assigned shortcut) that I no longer want to do without it. What does all this have to do with CleanShot? This function is also implemented and so much more. Also available via <a href="https://setapp.com/">Setapp</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/">Rocket</a>: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Mind-blowing emoji on your Mac.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I really enjoy using this emoji picker. Tried using the one from Recast but went back to Rocket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amicoapps.com/app/quitall/">Quitall</a>: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Before you Force Quit, QuitAll. A fresh start without a restart.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> If it wasn&rsquo;t included in my <a href="https://setapp.com/">Setapp</a> subscription I probably would not have bought it. I know it&rsquo;s a bad habit under macOS to quit apps but sometimes I have so many of them open, that I prefer a fresh start. That&rsquo;s were Quintal comes into play.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://hookproductivity.com">Hookmark</a>: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Search Less. Focus more.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> If you haven&rsquo;t heart of Hookmark yet, go and check it out. It&rsquo;s really awesome and I wish something like this was build directly into macOS. You can more or less interlink everything. Also available via <a href="https://setapp.com/">Setapp</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And of course there are some productivity apps I mainly use for work <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dash<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DevonThink<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Default Folder X<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Keyboard Maestro<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hazel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ChronoSync<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Maybe I&rsquo;ll write a little more about them later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, I would have forgotten about <a href="https://bombich.com/de">CCC</a>: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;CCC does everything you wish Time Machine did (and more!)&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Buy it, use it! (Or <a href="https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper!</a> I don&rsquo;t care üòé)</p>
</li>
</ul>

			 <p>I was motivated by <a href="https://micro.blog/muhh">muhh</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.byzero.de/2023/01/08/week-its-a.html">blog entry</a> to write down what was on my mind in the first week of January. I&rsquo;m not sure yet if this will become something more regular, but I wanted to start putting something online more often anyway - more on that below.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the last two weeks off. The weather was bad, I had a cold ü§ß and therefore a lot of cycling wasn&rsquo;t an option either (at least that&rsquo;s what I told myself). So, I used the time to hang out at the computer a little more than usally. There was a lot of exciting things to discover there.
Somehow Elon started this with the downfall of twitter, which he initiated. I had only been there reading for years anyway, and then after the takeover I decided to download my data, delete the clients on my end devices and no longer use the account.</p>
<p>As an alternative, I was of course interested in Mastodon and clicked an account on the standard instance <a href="https://mastodon.social">mastodon.social</a>. Thanks to tools like <a href="https://www.movetodon.org">movetodon</a> and <a href="https://glitch.com/~fedifinder">fedifinder</a> my timeline has also filled up pretty quickly, and I actually &ldquo;met&rdquo; pretty quickly some real people with whom you could exchange ideas in a friendly manner. All in all a very positive experience.</p>
<p>One great thing about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">fediverse </a> is the extreme dynamics of the tools and clients that are currently being built around it. It feels like back in the early days of Twitter where, for example, a single programmer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loren_Brichter">Loren Brichter</a>, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweetie">Tweetie</a> could turn the whole twitter landscape upside down. (BTW he only has an <a href="https://mastodon.cloud/@loren">inactive account</a> on Mastodon üò¢)</p>
<p>I tried countless clients over a few days. Among others (unsorted)</p>
<ul>

<li>Ivory (beta; officially alpha ;-)</li>
</ul>
<p>The official app is okay, but IMHO not great; toot! I liked the range of functions very much, but you also have to cope with the strange design somehow. Because I follow some accounts that post a lot, and since the timeline on Mastodon is not orchestrated by any algorithms, posts from other people are in danger of being lost. Thats why a good list function is very important to me personally. There, Mammoth also makes a very good impression, but in the end I was lucky and was able to test <a href="https://tapbots.social/@ivory">Ivory</a> via Testflight. The app by <a href="https://tapbots.social/@paul">Paul Haddad</a> and <a href="https://tapbots.social/@mark">Mark Jardine</a> has an button design that is a bit too playful for my taste, but otherwise it is extremely stable and really great at everything it does. The recently added <a href="https://social.lol/@esamecar/109653526172609597">list features</a> are awesome, as they allow certain accounts to be hidden from the home view. So, atm I stick to Ivory and am looking forward to even better builds.</p>
<p>Then, sometime last week, I came across a <a href="https://social.lol/@otaviocc/109607448264194924">post</a> from <a href="https://social.lol/@otaviocc">@otaviocc@social.lol</a> on <a href="https://home.omg.lol">omg.lol</a>. And then, coincidentally, I signed up for the service with thousands of other people (<a href="https://omglol.news/2023/01/07/wildest-36-hours-ever">who must have read a post on Hacker News</a> and not otaviocc&rsquo;s post üòé).
On omg.lol you ultimately get a &ldquo;funny&rdquo; address on the web that contains a wide variety of small services. A single page website (to use as a <a href="https://esamecar.omg.lol">business card</a>), a <a href="http://esamecar.status.lol">statuslog</a>, an omg.lol-email address (forwarder), different DNS services, pastebin, PURL service, a <a href="http://esamecar.weblog.lol">weblog</a> (beta), etc. And while I was at it anyways, I also have my <a href="https://social.lol/@esamecar">Mastodon</a> account moved from mastodon.social to <a href="https://social.lol">social.lol</a>. Luckily that went really smoothly. It was a lot of fun getting involved, configuring everything and thinking about what it&rsquo;s even good for ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I continued to work with the <a href="https://www.ankermake.com/eu-en">AnkerMake M5</a>, which also arrived after a very long wait at the beginning of December. All in all I&rsquo;m very happy with the 3D printer, but still don&rsquo;t really know what got into me back in early 2022 when I backed it on Kickstarter. But that is definitely going too far at this point and maybe I&rsquo;ll go into more detail elsewhere.</p>
<p>Well, micro.blog is kind of a universe in itself too. In addition to choosing a <a href="https://social.lol/@muhh/109652832580041607">theme</a>, there is of course the client question. I got some for iOS (the official <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1253201335">app</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1437753701">Gluon for Micro.blog</a> and MacOS (<a href="https://redsweater.com/marsedit">MarsEdit 5</a>, which I use via <a href="https://setapp.com">Setapp</a>) looked at various editors (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ia-writer/id775737172">iA Writer</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/drafts/id1236254471">Drafts</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/runestone-text-editor/id1548193893">Runestone</a>. In addition, there are useful tools as <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696">Mimi Uploader</a> (iOS) to upload images and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1592173492">Epilogue for Micro.blog</a> to track books, but I&rsquo;m just starting out here, there are just too many apps and I have to see which ones &ldquo;click&rdquo; for me.</p>
<p>There are of course all sorts of little helpers for publishing interesting links and posts on Mastodon or blog entries. Among others <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/linky-for-twitter-and-mastodon/id438090426">Linky</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/re-toot/id1661697436">Re: Toot</a> by <a href="https://social.lol/@simonbs@mastodon.social">Simon B. St√∏vring</a> (who, by the way, is also responsible for Runestone) I would like to mention at this point.</p>
<p>As if all that wasn&rsquo;t enough, at the beginning of last week, after a 1.5 year wait, I received my long-awaited <a href="https://play.date">playdate</a> game console. (In the meantime I had actually already forgotten that I had even ordered it and I was all the happier that it suddenly arrived.) It&rsquo;s a lot of fun to deal with the little yellow box and I wanted to jot down some impressions I got. I rented a domain with Wordpress installed last year already and tried a few things with <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a> but didn&rsquo;t really publish anything on either platform. This year I wanted to change that and thus started with a <a href="https://esamecar.de/2023/01/07/playdate.html">post about the playdate</a>.</p>
<p>All in all, it was an exciting time in terms of IT. Now all of a sudden I somehow have <a href="https://esamecar.de/2023/01/07/hello-world.html">three blogs</a> and will soon have to concentrate on one of them and see when everyday work starts again tomorrow, whether I still have the time and, above all, the desire to continue writing down my thoughts, or these escapades were again one of my &ldquo;manic&rdquo; excursions into something new and I would lose interest again the day after tomorrow - which would be a pity.</p>
<p>So, maybe cu next week üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
<p>PS: initally, I wanted to talk a little bit about the music and podcasts I&rsquo;ve listened to, too but this post is already way too long.</p>

			 <p>I have been using <a href="https://www.shelly.cloud/de">Shelly Plug S</a> plug adapters for some time now and am very happy with them. They are inexpensive, run reliably and can be controlled easily within your own network via REST API. The only thing they are not compatible with is HomeKit. Thanks to <a href="https://www.appgefahren.de/shelly-plug-s-smarter-zwischenstecker-fuer-1590-euro-im-angebot-329891.html">appgefahren.de</a> I just stumbled across a custom firmware published on <a href="https://github.com/mongoose-os-apps/shelly-homekit">github</a>, which can be installed via a single URL call. Then you can hang via QR code the plug super easy in HomeKit. However, with HomeKit integration, you give up the ability to use the Shelly Cloud and therefore its native app. Of course, this should be weighed up carefully beforehand. However, the way back to the original firmware should be just as easy.</p>
